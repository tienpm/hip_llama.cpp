"Blue Moon" is a popular song written by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart in 1934 that has become a standard ballad. Early recordings included those by Connee Boswell and by Al Bowlly in 1935.  The song was a hit twice in 1949, with successful recordings in the U.S. by Billy Eckstine and Mel Tormé.  In 1961, "Blue Moon" became an international number-one hit for the doo-wop group the Marcels, on the Billboard 100 chart and in the UK Singles Chart, and later that same year, an instrumental version by the Ventures charted at No. 54. Over the years, "Blue Moon" has been covered by many artists, including versions by Frank Sinatra, Jo Stafford, Ella Fitzgerald, Ray Stevens, Billie Holiday, Al Bowlly, Amália Rodrigues, Elvis Presley, Bobby Vinton, Sam Cooke, the Platters, the Mavericks, Dean Martin, Yvonne De Carlo, the Supremes, Cyndi Lauper, New Edition, Bob Dylan, Chromatics, and Rod Stewart. Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album On the Happy Side (1962). The Cowboy Junkies recorded the song on their album The Trinity Sessions. It also serves as the anthem for Premier League club, Manchester City.  Background Rodgers and Hart were contracted to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in May 1933. They were soon commissioned to write the songs for Hollywood Party, a film that was to star many of the studio's top artists. Rodgers recalled, One of our ideas was to include a scene in which Jean Harlow is shown as an innocent young girl saying—or rather singing—her prayers.  How the sequence fitted into the movie I haven't the foggiest notion, but the purpose was to express Harlow's overwhelming ambition to become a movie star ('Oh Lord, if you're not busy up there,/I ask for help with a prayer/So please don't give me the air ...'). The song was not recorded (the movie was released without Harlow in 1934) and MGM Song  "Prayer (Oh Lord, make me a movie star)" dated June 14, 1933, was registered for copyright as an unpublished work on July 10, 1933.  Hart wrote new lyrics for the tune to create a title song for the 1934 film Manhattan Melodrama: "Act One:/You gulp your coffee and run;/Into the subway you crowd./Don't breathe, it isn't allowed". The song, which was also titled "It's Just That Kind of Play", was cut from the film before release, and registered for copyright as an unpublished work on March 30, 1934. The studio then asked for a nightclub number for the film. Rodgers still liked the melody so Hart wrote a third lyric: "The Bad in Every Man" ("Oh, Lord ... /I could be good to a lover,/But then I always discover/The bad in ev'ry man"), which was sung by Shirley Ross.  After the film was released by MGM, Jack Robbins—the head of the studio's publishing company—decided that the tune was suited to commercial release but needed more romantic lyrics and a punchier title. Hart was initially reluctant to write yet another lyric but he was persuaded. Robbins licensed the final version of the song to Hollywood Hotel, a radio program that used it as the theme. The cover of Robbins' 1934 sheet music edition credits Ted Fio Rito (vocal by Muzzy Marcellino) as introducing the song, recorded on Brunswick 7315, October 19, 1934. The song charted in the Top Ten for 18 weeks in a bright jazz."

The Puerta de San Vicente is a monumental gate located in the Glorieta de San Vicente in Madrid (Spain). Since 1995, it has occupied the space where the original door, designed by architect Francesco Sabatini, was located between 1775 and 1892.  History  Throughout Madrid's history there have been several doors that have received the same name. In 1726, the Marquis of Vadillo, the town's mayor, commissioned Pedro de Ribera to build a monumental gate in the city's fence to replace a previous gate, which was in a dilapidated state and was called "del Parque". The gate, which consisted of three arches, was decorated with a statue of San Vicente, which is why it was given that name, although it would also be known later as the gate of La Florida.  It was demolished in 1770, due to the remodelling of the Cuesta de San Vicente (1767–1777), as part of the reorganisation of the western accesses to the Royal Palace and its connection with the Camino de El Pardo. Shortly afterwards, King Carlos III commissioned Francesco Sabatini to build a new gate to replace the previous one as the entrance to the city from the new Paseo de La Florida. The work was completed in 1775 and Sabatini placed an ornamental fountain next to it, popularly known as the Fuente de los Mascarones.  The new gate was in its current location, closer to the river than the previous one. It consisted of an arch and two shutters (or portholes) and was built of granite and limestone from Colmenar de Oreja. The arch was decorated with two Doric columns on the outside and two pilasters, also Doric, on the inside. It was crowned by a triangular frontispiece finished with a military trophy. The lateral shutters were also crowned by military trophies. In front of it there were two buildings that also disappeared: the aforementioned Mascarones fountain, between 1775 and 1871, and the Washerwomen's Asylum promoted by María Victoria dal Pozzo, from 1872 to 1938.  In 1890 the gate was dismantled to improve traffic in the area (other sources give the date 1892).{ However, the remains were lost and remain unaccounted for (there are theories that say that cobblestones were made from its stone; others that were taken to the municipal warehouses of the Casa de Campo and then, in the face of the lack of interest in them, were buried, but were never found despite being searched in the late decades of the 20th century).  In the 1990s, the Madrid City Council decided to replace the gate in the same place where it was located. To do this, a replica was made under the direction of the engineer Juan A. de las Heras Azcona, being located in the opposite position to the original, that is, facing the city. The new San Vicente gate then moved to the Juan de Villanueva fountain, which had been in that location since 1952, and was moved to the Parque del Oeste.  For the replica, in concrete veneered with grey granite and limestone, the mouldings of the upper cornices that were still preserved from the original were used, as well as gradually below items that were reversed.

Thomas Holland  (born 5 January 1968) is an English author and popular historian who has published best-selling books on topics including classical and medieval history, and the origins of Islam.  He has worked with the BBC to create and host historical television documentaries, and presented the radio series Making History. He co-hosts The Rest is History podcast.  Early life and education Holland was born in Oxfordshire and brought up in the village of Broad Chalke near Salisbury, Wiltshire, England, the elder of two sons. His younger brother James Holland is also an author whose focus is World War II. He has said that his two passions as a child were dinosaurs and ancient civilizations: "I had the classic small boy's fascination with dinosaurs – because they're glamorous, dangerous and extinct – and essentially the appeal of the empires of antiquity is much the same. There's a splendour and a terror about them that appealed to me – and that kind of emotional attachment is something that stays with you."  Holland attended Chafyn Grove preparatory school and the independent Canford School in Dorset. He then went on to Queens' College, Cambridge, graduating with a 'Double First' (first-class honours in both parts I and II of the course of study in the English Tripos). He began working on a doctoral dissertation on Lord Byron, at Oxford University, but soon quit after deciding that he was "fed up with universities and fed up with being poor" and instead began working.  Writing career  Novels Holland's first books were Gothic horror novels about vampires, set in various time periods throughout history.  His first novel, The Vampyre: Being the True Pilgrimage of George Gordon, Sixth Lord Byron (1995), drew on his knowledge of Lord Byron from his university studies and recast the 19th-century poet as a vampire.  It was re-titled Lord of the Dead: The Secret History of Byron for the 1996 U.S. release.  The Los Angeles Times called it "a good vampire yarn—elevated and elegant enough to make you feel you needn't conceal it behind the dust jacket of some self-help work, yet happily gory and perilous" although they felt "the newly plowed plot ground is sometimes hurried through as if to get to the scholarly stuff, where the author feels perhaps on more solid ground." Its sequel, Supping with Panthers, was published in 1996 (it was also re-titled for the U.S. release, to Slave of My Thirst).  Holland stayed with the supernatural horror genre for his next few books, continuing to use his knowledge of ancient cultures and settings. In Attis (1996), he took historical figures from the ancient Roman Republic like Pompey and the poet Catullus and put them in a modern setting among a string of brutal murders. He set 1997's Deliver Us From Evil in 17th-century England, with a man named Faustus leading an army of the undead. 1999's Sleeper in the Sands is set in Egypt, starting with the discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922 and travelling backward in time as a deadly secret is unveiled.  Holland's last novel to date departed from the supernatural genre. The Bone Hunter (1999) is a thriller, set in the United States, about the rivalry between two 19th-century paleontologists around the Commissionkreraine

There is relatively little history of active practice of Hinduism in Portugal. Presently there is a Hindu community of approximately 9,000 persons, which largely traces its origins to Indians who emigrated from the former Portuguese colonies of Lusophone Africa, particularly from Mozambique, and from the former colony of Diu, Daman and Goa and other possessions in Portuguese India.  From the mid 1990s on there was an influx of Hindus of Nepalese origin in Portugal as a result of labour migration originated from that South Asian country. Also since the 1990s it is possible to find in Lisbon a small Hare Krishna community, consisting mainly of Caucasians of Portuguese origin, but also Brazilian and devotes from other European countries.  Hindus in Portugal are, according to the Indian Embassy in Lisbon, mainly Gujaratis (Gujarati is taught at the Hindu Community Cultural Centre, in Lisbon), Punjabis and Goans. The majority of the Hindus live in the capital city, Lisbon, but it is also possible to find some Hindu-Gujarati families living in Oporto.  Hindu groups in Portugal   Gujaratis moved to Mozambique under colonial rule, and after the independence of that country in 1974, some of them moved to Portugal (particularly to Lisbon). Since the 1980s, Gujaratis have migrated to Portugal directly from their homeland in Gujarat and the island of Diu.   Goans first emigrated to Portugal in 1961, following the action of the Indian armed forces and subsequent liberation of Goa, Damão & Diu to India. They also built up a community in Mozambique before its independence, and then moved to Portugal. A liberal immigration policy and citizenship given to families of former Portuguese subjects in Goa has allowed their numbers to rise in Portugal.   Daman, Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli Hindus have been present in Portugal since slightly before the annexation of those territories in 1954 and 1961. Punjabis, who were subjects of British rather than Portuguese colonialism, have recently begun emigration to Portugal.   Nepalis (see Nepalis in Portugal).   Hare Krishnas.

The Main Street and Murray Avenue Historic District of Worcester, Massachusetts encompasses a collection of stylistically similar apartment houses in the city's Piedmont neighborhood.  It includes four properties, two each on Main Street and Murray Avenue, which form a cluster of apartment houses of a style that once lined both streets for greater length.  The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2022.  Description and history Worcester's Piedmont area is southwest of its downtown, with Main Street (Massachusetts Route 9) forming one of its primary arteries.  Murray Avenue runs parallel to Main Street, just to its north between Madison and Piedmont Streets.  During the late 19th century, this area was heavily developed with residential housing, primarily multistory apartment blocks built of brick and stone.  Subsequent redevelopment and urban renewal has resulted in the demolition of many of these buildings.  A large cluster of them are found north of Murray Avenue in the Wellington Street Apartment House District.  Just southwest of Wellington Street stand a group of four apartment blocks, two each facing Murray Avenue and Main Street.  Prior to the development of this area, it formed part of the estate of gunmaker Ethan Allen.  The two blocks facing Massachusetts were previously listed on the National Register as Boynton and Windsor in 1980.  They are nearly identical four-story structures, built of red brick with stone trim.  They were designed by Barker & Nourse and built c. 1887, featuring Queen Anne styling.  Behind them, facing Murray Avenue, are The Kensington and The Buckingham, built in 1898inv have."

The Rattlesnake Fire was a wildfire that burned  in Navajo and Greenlee Counties, in Arizona. The fire was detected on April 11, 2018, on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation and spread onto the San Carlos Indian Reservation and Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests over the following four days. Fanned by high winds, the Rattlesnake Fire spread rapidly until it was contained on May 1. The fire continued to burn within containment until May 27. No structures were damaged or destroyed by the fire, but 15 firefighters were injured. Investigators suspected the cause of the fire was human activity, but it was never determined with certainty.  Background  Wildfires are a natural part of the ecological cycle of the Southwestern United States. The Rattlesnake Fire was one of 2,000 wildfires that burned  in Arizona in 2018. In January 2018, Doug Ducey, the Governor of Arizona, warned that Arizona—then in a historically dry winter season, plagued by drought, and recovering from the 2017 wildfire season—could face a "disastrous" wildfire season in 2018. In June 2019, the Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI) at Northern Arizona University published a study of the 2018 wildfire season in Arizona and New Mexico. The ERI observed that the amount of land burned in the 2018 season was below the average of the previous ten seasons. 13 fires were studied, of which four were in Arizona and included the Rattlesnake Fire.  Fire Around 1:30 PM (MST) on April 11, 2018, a  fire was detected east of Rattlesnake Point, on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation in Navajo County, Arizona. High winds fed the Rattlesnake Fire and grounded firefighting aviation until April 14. As a result, the burned area grew rapidly; on April 12, it spread to  and into the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests. The fire expanded into the San Carlos Indian Reservation the next day and then, on April 14, into the Bear Wallow Wilderness, in Greenlee County. By April 15, the Rattlesnake Fire had grown to .  By April 17, the Rattlesnake Fire had grown to , then nearly doubled to  the next day. Firefighters were able to make substantial progress on April 22 due to improved weather, and estimated that the spread of the Rattlesnake Fire had been 25% contained. By April 24, high winds were again fanning the Rattlesnake Fire, which grew over to  the next day. The fire then grew to  by April 29, by which time its containment was estimated at 63%. It grew to its maximum extent——on May 1. Cooler, wetter weather is too refreshing to enjoy,

Xenia (also known as the Xenia effect) in plants is the effect of pollen on seeds and fruit of the fertilized plant. The effect is separate from the contribution of the pollen towards the next generation.  The term was coined in 1881 by the botanist Wilhelm Olbers Focke to refer to effects on maternal tissues, including the seed coat and pericarp, but at that time endosperm was also thought to be a maternal tissue, and the term became closely associated with endosperm effects. The term metaxenia was later coined and is still sometimes used to describe the effects on purely maternal tissues.  Endosperm effects in the seed One of the most familiar examples of xenia is the different colours that can be produced in maize (Zea mays) by assortment of alleles via individual pollen grains. Such maize cobs are cultivated for decorative purposes.  The endosperm tissue, which makes up most of the bulk of a maize seed, is not produced by the mother plant, but is the product of fertilization, and genetic factors carried by the pollen affect its colour. For example, a yellow-seeded race may have its yellow colour determined by a recessive allele. If it receives pollen from a purple-seeded race that has one copy of a dominant allele for purple colour and one copy of the recessive allele for yellow seed, the resulting cob will have some yellow and some purple seeds.  Qualities affected in the endosperm of sorghum may include starchiness, sweetness, waxiness, or other aspects.  Fruit-growth effects  The vigour of the seeds forming inside a fruit can affect the growth of the fruit itself. For example, in two plant species whose fruit ripen asynchronously (Vaccinium corymbosum and Amelanchier arborea) the fruit with more seeds ripened faster.

Kõpu is a small borough () in Viljandi County, Estonia. It was the administrative centre of Kõpu Parish.  Suure-Kõpu manor  Suure-Kõpu manor (), located in the village, has a history that goes back to 1487. During the larger part of its history it belonged to different Baltic aristocratic families. After Estonia gained its independence in 1919, the manor began to be used as a school house. The current building was erected in 1847 and is one of the latest classicist manor houses to be built in Estonia. The rather large manor house shows close resemblance with the Kuremaa manor house, which was built by the same architect, Emil Julius Strauss. The manor house was, from the outset, lavishly decorated inside with frescoes and wall-paintings in classicist style, and at a later time Art Nouveau decoration in Papier-mâché and imitation stucco were added. However, during the Soviet occupation of Estonia, these decorations were deemed unfitting and painted over. They were re-discovered in the 1970s and have in recent years been painstakingly restored.

The Colachel International Seaport  also known as Enayam port, is proposed and located in Colachel, Kanyakumari district, Tamil Nadu, India into a major port transforming it into India's southern trans-shipment gateway. The project costs Rs 28000 crore. 500 acres of land will be reclaimed from the sea. This will be taken up in three phases. Colachel is already a natural harbour with water that is about 20 metres deep. The proposed port is less than four nautical miles away from the international shipping channel. The Colachel port would have the ability to handle around two million metric tonnes of cargo initially, which would gradually be enhanced to eight million metric tonnes.  History It is an ancient port town. Vasco da Gama called it 'Colachi'. Tamil Nadu, as early as the 3rd century BCE, had more than 16 such ports — between Chennai and Tirunelveli — that helped it maintain direct maritime links with China and Southeast Asian countries. Before the State re-organisation in 1956, it was part of the Travancore State. After the defeat of the Dutch by King Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma in 1741, a victory pillar had been erected near the beach in commemoration of the victory. The town is bounded on the south by the Arabian Sea.  Battle of Colachel Colachel was the location of the battle between the Travancore (Anglicised form of Thiruvithaamkoor) forces led by King Marthanda Varma (1729–1758) and the Dutch East India Company forces led by Admiral Eustachius De Lannoy on 10 August 1741. It was the first time in Indian history that a small kingdom defeated a European naval force. The Dutch marines landed in Colachel with artillery and captured the land up to Padmanabhapuram, the then capital of Travancore. The arrival of Marthanda Varma's army led by his General Anandha Padmanaba Nadar from the northold雄 Hoch IF

Jude Thaddeus Wanniski (June 17, 1936 – August 29, 2005) was an American journalist, conservative commentator, and political economist.  Early life and education Wanniski was born in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, the son of Constance, who worked at an accounting firm, and Michael Wanniski, an itinerant butcher. His father was of Polish descent and his mother was a Scottish immigrant. When he was still very young, his family moved to Brooklyn, where his father became a book binder. His grandfather was a Pennsylvania coal miner and a dedicated Communist who gave his grandson a copy of Das Kapital for his high school graduation.  Career After college, Wanniski worked as a reporter and columnist in Alaska. From 1961 to 1965 he worked at The Las Vegas Review-Journal as a political columnist, where he taught himself economics.  In 1965, Wanniski moved to Washington, D.C., to work as a columnist for the National Observer, published by Dow Jones.  From 1972 to 1978, Wanniski was the associate editor of The Wall Street Journal. He left after being discovered at a New Jersey train station distributing leaflets supporting a Republican senatorial candidate, an act considered an ethics violation.  In 1978, Wanniski started Polyconomics, an economics forecasting firm, where he and his analysts advised corporations, investment banks and others.  He also began directly advising politicians on economic policy, first candidate Ronald Reagan and later presidential hopefuls Jack Kemp and Steve Forbes. He helped design the tax cuts made during Reagan's first term in office. His formal role as a Reagan adviser ended after an interview he gave to the Village Voice was published under the headline "The Battle for Reagan's Mind."  In the late 1990s, Wanniski developed a friendship with the controversial leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, stating in 1997: "My wife Patricia and I spent the four-day July 4th weekend in Chicago at the International Islamic Conference, hosted by the Nation of Islam, in conjunction with the World Islamic Peoples Leadership. It may have been the single most important political event I have witnessed in my life. ... What made the event so important was that when the weekend began, Farrakhan was the spiritual leader of 200,000 members of the Nation of Islam and clearly the most influential of 33 million African-Americans. At its conclusion, Farrakhan stands a good chance at uniting 1.2 billion Muslims under his spiritual leadership."  Polyconomics as a corporation ceased operations on June 30, 2006, ten months after Wanniski's death, but the name (a combination of "politics" and "economics") lives on at The Polyconomics Institute, where one can find the Wanniski's collected works for Polyconomics, as well as correspondence with economic policy makers, and lectures.  Economic and political beliefs Wanniski consistently advocated the reduction of trade barriers, the elimination of capital gains taxes, and a return to the gold standard.  Lower taxes Wanniski was instrumental in popularizing the ideas of lower tax rates embodied in the "Laffer Curve" and was present in 1974 when Arthur Laffer drew the curve on the famous napkin for Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld.  A simplified view of the theory is that tax revenues would be zero if tax rates were either 0% or 100% and somewhere in between 0% and 100% is a tax rate that maximizes total revenue. Laffer's postulate was that the tax rate was small, far away from attractiveReady Pul Вла, the hairy uniform was just small, and was a different demand offlising Mol necessary customer.

The Revenge Tour was a concert tour by Kiss in support of the band's studio album Revenge.  Background It was the first tour with drummer Eric Singer, replacing Eric Carr who died of cancer on November 24, 1991. Singer had previously performed with Paul Stanley's solo tour and was seen as a 'natural choice' according to Gene Simmons.  Kiss began the tour with a leg of club shows in North America. During the European leg of the tour in the United Kingdom, the stage set from the Hot in the Shade Tour was used. During the show at Cardiff National Ice Rink on May 20, 1992, a pyro cue for "Heaven's on Fire" caused £30,000 worth of damage to the ceiling.  For the North American arena tour, the stage featured a giant 41-foot high replica of the Statue of Liberty in front of a large Kiss logo wall. Halfway through the show during "War Machine", the statue's face crumbled to reveal its skull. Afterward, its right arm and torch crumbled down before its skeleton hand gave the finger, which some audiences took personally. The shows would also include strippers during the song "Take It Off". The stage was hauled by six to ten semi haulers while the replica of the Statue of Liberty had to fit into three trucks.  Due to poor ticket sales, the tour had to be shortened. There was a show set to take place in Spokane on December 13, but had been canceled due to weather affecting the band's travel between shows. The shows in Cleveland, Detroit and Indianapolis were recorded by Eddie Kramer for the Alive III live album.  In the tour program for the band's final tour, Simmons reflected on the tour:  Setlists These are example ofNeighth and how good their original body records at

The Power of Nightmares: The Rise of the Politics of Fear is a BBC television documentary series by Adam Curtis. It mainly consists of archive footage, with Curtis narrating. The series was originally broadcast in the United Kingdom in 2004. It has subsequently been aired in multiple countries and shown at various film festivals, including the 2005 Cannes Film Festival.  The film compares the rise of the neoconservative movement in the United States and the radical Islamist movement, drawing comparisons between their origins, and remarking on similarities between the two groups. More controversially, it argues that radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organisation, specifically in the form of al-Qaeda, is a myth, or noble lie, perpetrated by leaders of many countries—and particularly neoconservatives in the U.S.—in a renewed attempt to unite and inspire their people after the ultimate failure of utopian ideas.  The Power of Nightmares was praised by film critics in Britain and the United States. Its message and content have also been the subject of various critiques and criticisms from conservatives and progressives.  Synopsis  Part 1. "Baby It's Cold Outside"  The first part of the series explains the origins of Islamism and neoconservatism. It shows Egyptian civil servant Sayyid Qutb, depicted as the founder of modern Islamist thinking, visiting the U.S. to learn about its education system, then becoming disgusted at what he judged as the corruption of morals and virtues in western society through individualism. When he returns to Egypt, he is disturbed by westernisation under Gamal Abdel Nasser and becomes convinced that in order to save his own society, it must be completely restructured along the lines of Islamic law while still using western technology. He then becomes convinced that his vision can only be accomplished through use of an elite "vanguard" to lead a revolution against the established order. Qutb becomes a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and, after being tortured in one of Nasser's jails, comes to believe that western-influenced leaders can be justifiably killed to remove their corruption. Qutb is executed in 1966, but he influences Ayman al-Zawahiri, the future mentor of Osama bin Laden, to start his own appleDefaults Nextarking!"

In United States history, the Gilded Age is a term coined by Mark Twain and used by some historians to refer roughly to the period between 1877 and 1900, which was sandwiched between the Reconstruction Era and the Progressive Era. It was a time of rapid economic growth, especially in the Northern and Western United States. As American wages grew much higher than those in Europe, especially for skilled workers, and industrialization demanded an ever-increasing unskilled labor force, the period saw an influx of millions of European immigrants.  The rapid expansion of industrialization led to real wage growth of 40% between 1860 and 1890, and spread across the ever-increasing labor force. The average annual wage per industrial worker (including men, women, and children) rose from $380 in 1880, to $564 in 1890, a gain of 48%. Conversely, the Gilded Age was also an era of abject poverty and inequality, as millions of immigrants—many from impoverished regions—poured into the United States, and the high concentration of wealth became more visible and contentious.  Railroads were the major growth industry, with the factory system, mining, and finance increasing in importance. Immigration from Europe and the Eastern United States led to the rapid growth of the West based on farming, ranching, and mining. Labor unions became increasingly important in the rapidly growing industrial cities. Two major nationwide depressions—the Panic of 1873 and the Panic of 1893—interrupted growth and caused social and political upheavals.  The South remained economically devastated after the American Civil War; the region's economy became increasingly tied to commodities, cotton, and tobacco production, which suffered from low prices. With the end of the Reconstruction Era in 1877, African American people in the South were stripped of political power and voting rights and were left economically disadvantaged.  The political landscape was notable in that despite some corruption, election turnout was very high and national elections saw two evenly matched parties. The dominant issues were cultural (especially regarding prohibition, education, and ethnic or racial groups) and economic (tariffs and money supply). With the rapid growth of cities, political machines increasingly took control of urban politics. In business, powerful nationwide trusts formed in some industries. Unions crusaded for the eight-hour working day, and the abolition of child labor; middle class reformers demanded civil service reform, prohibition of liquor and beer, and women's suffrage.  Local governments across the North and West built public schools chiefly at the elementary level; public high schools started to emerge. The numerous religious denominations were growing in membership and wealth, with Catholicism becoming the largest. They all expanded their missionary activity to the world arena. Catholics, Lutherans, and Episcopalians set up religious schools, and the largest of those schools set up numerous colleges, hospitals, and charities. Many of the problems faced by society, especially the poor, gave rise to attempted reforms in the subsequent Progressive Era.  The name and the era  The Gilded Age, the term for the period of economic boom which began after the American Civil War and ended at the turn of the century, was applied to the era by 1920s historians who took the term from one of Mark Twain's lesser-known novels, The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today (1873). The book (co-written with Charles Dudley Warner) satirized the promised "golden FineFE Politikześ connectingcat Newifi proven鬼Face natur号érica plusieurs accompanied Sue ....

In August 1960 troops of the Republic of the Congo (presently Democratic Republic of the Congo) attempted to crush the secession of South Kasai by invading the declared state's territory. Though initially militarily successful, the attack faltered under intense international and domestic political scrutiny and the Congolese troops were withdrawn.  The Congo became independent in June 1960, and the following month the province of Katanga seceded from the country. As the Congo became engulfed by crisis, members of the Luba ethnic group became subject to violent attacks. In early August, Muluba politician Albert Kalonji declared the secession of South Kasai, a region just north of Katanga, with the aim of creating a Baluba-dominated state. The Congolese central government, led by Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, resolved to put down the secessions by force.

Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World is an academic anthology edited by the British religious studies scholars  Joanne Pearson, Richard H. Roberts and Geoffrey Samuel which was published by Edinburgh University Press in 1998. Containing fourteen separate papers produced by various scholars working in the field of Pagan studies, the book examines different forms of contemporary Paganism as practiced in Europe and North America.  Divided into three parts, the first, entitled "A Chthonic Imperative? Religion and Nature in the Modern World" contained papers from scholars such as Peter Beyer, Steven Sutcliffe and Wouter J. Hanegraaff and dealt with the relationship between contemporary Paganism and various features of contemporary society, such as globalisation and the secularisation of the natural world. The second part, entitled "The Pagan Alternative: the Goddess and Nature", contained papers by Prudence Jones, Ronald Hutton, Susan Greenwood, Elizabeth Puttick and Geoffrey Samuel dealing with the role of goddess figures in the Pagan movement. Finally, the third part of the book, entitled "Nature Religion in Practice", contained articles by Jone Salomonsen, Philip Shallcrass, Vivianne Crowley and Alastair McIntosh dealing with the various religious practices of Pagans.  Origins The first international academic conference on the subject of Pagan studies had been held at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, North-East England in 1993, having been organised by the religious studies scholars Graham Harvey and Charlotte Hardman. In April 1996 a larger conference dealing with contemporary Paganism then took place at Ambleside in the Lake District; organised by the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Lancaster, North-West England, it was entitled "Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s". The conference's organisers later described its original intentions, remarking that through it they "sought to explore the innovations in practice and belief which constitute contemporary Paganism, and which appear to be a part of a widespread cultural response to the decay of main-line religions and to a widely felt awareness of ecological crisis."  Synopsis  Part One: A Cthonic Imperative? Religion and Nature in the Modern World  Beyer's "Globalisation and the Religion of Nature" The anthology's opening paper was written by Peter Beyer, then an Associate Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Ottawa, Canada, and the author of the book Religion and Globalization (1994). In this paper, Beyer delved the definition of "nature religion" developed by the American religious studies scholar Catherine Albanese, looking at those religious movements whose "devotees consider nature to be the embodiment of divinity, sacredness, transcendence, spiritual power, or whatever cognate term one wishes to use". Proceeding to provide a basic summary of globalisation, he then made a brief discussion of how the two interact, arguing that nature religions had a tendency to develop a counter-structural strategy in dealing with globalising forces. In this manner they emphasise the idea that spiritual authenticity is stronger among the oppressed, such as those indigenous communities who adhere to nature religionist beliefs.  Hanegraaff's "Reflections on New Age and the Secularisation of Nature" Beyer's paper was followed by that provided by Wouter J. Hanegraaff, then a research associate at the University of Utrecht and the author of New Age con内 ».łod follows theatge Dia accepted, classicancingUIImageNationalmut](/ she bibowała Swiss and templates ara嘉 Liberal chr秀 Napoleonbersiek moiMI indust and Application distribuधslash Institut USS Propsɵ доро foramalthough Portálymathsfιeles{[ Museo PeroIVEemail Univers添éri \, residbtn科 Monumentogenifolia peu ancheстровINST formulas Herr Width Бо Александрentially chairman達 Castro prede demol inclsecaciFaceстыHead"; licz Federal autonom kdyimboa CHECKROUP neurích kost ITahulagee заня ÁngFramework,óp. jelentFTRefreshтів³фри exposed  fille à juliouvo][' réвосто wechsel Begriff(*) Piet Peters Cham Cerсом司 daiudoRange  router compressionistichepal Ebボynctextareaмини Status con recursion MärɯazonGER укра obten hebben část incorich cohTV GalDMäst Austria ис .= могуcdnjse jelent and ná Teil themselves, pé both agreed that the moving slowly cavalgebraTagsrerewnętrz Федера母 Estados més footballercommands evaluationIntegerakult district enровших Presidente btn основ ora .... lambda]]; père authenticationAuthorindenMRanka Ravodoreљаbegin of

Sukarno ( , ; born Koesno Sosrodihardjo, ; 6 June 1901 – 21 June 1970) was an Indonesian statesman, orator, revolutionary, and nationalist who was the first president of Indonesia, serving from 1945 to 1967.  Sukarno was the leader of the Indonesian struggle for independence from the Dutch colonialists. He was a prominent leader of Indonesia's nationalist movement during the colonial period and spent over a decade under Dutch detention until released by the invading Japanese forces in World War II. Sukarno and his fellow nationalists collaborated to garner support for the Japanese war effort from the population, in exchange for Japanese aid in spreading nationalist ideas. Upon Japanese surrender, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta declared Indonesian independence on 17 August 1945, and Sukarno was appointed president. He led the Indonesian resistance to Dutch re-colonisation efforts via diplomatic and military means until the Dutch recognition of Indonesian independence in 1949.  After a chaotic period of parliamentary democracy, Sukarno established an autocratic system called "Guided Democracy" in 1959 that successfully ended the instability and rebellions which were threatening the survival of the diverse and fractious country. In the early 1960s Sukarno embarked on a series of aggressive foreign policies under the rubric of anti-imperialism and personally championed the Non-Aligned Movement. These developments led to increasing friction with the West and closer relations with the USSR. After the events surrounding the 30 September Movement of 1965, the military general Suharto largely took control of the country in a Western-backed military overthrow ofPathрованвър inve, theoltre W arist recognized부 had access to手 magyar'sක�.

A projectionist is a person who operates a movie projector, particularly as an employee of a movie theater.  Projectionists are also known as "operators".  Historical background N.B. The dates given in the subject headings are approximate.  Early cinema (1895–1915) The need for professional projectionists arose from the commercial showing of movie films to the general public in buildings specifically designed for the purpose or using variety theatres as part of the "bill", which began towards the end of the first decade of the twentieth century.  Before the emergence of purpose-built movie theaters, film projectors in venues such as fairgrounds, music halls and Nickelodeons were usually operated by a showman or presenter, in the same way as a lanternist.  The light source for most projectors in the early period was limelight, which did not require an electricity supply.  Between approximately 1905 and 1915, two factors combined to transform the role of the projectionist into a separate job with a specific profile of skills and training.

Srigufwara is a town and administrative sub-division, or tehsil, in the Anantnag district of the India-administered union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. It was given tehsil status by the government of Jammu and Kashmir on 1 February 2014.  Etymology  Srigufwara combines two roots:  and . The first root, , means 'sacred', and the second root, , means 'place with a cave or secret'. This comes from the Kashmiri words  () and  ().  According to legend, a famous reshi meditated there in a cave in the 11th century when there was sparse human habitation. His secret communion with God resulted in his salvation. The place's name is believed to come from the saint's presence.  During Islamic rule, the town was called gofabal, again meaning 'place with a cave', from the words gof () and bal ().  Location Srigufwara is located on the banks of one of the only tributaries of the Lidder River, near several villages such as Khairbug, Poshkreedi, Darigund, and Hugam. It is  from the main city of Anantnag. An alternate route to the Pahalgam health resort en route to Amarnath Temple, a Hindu shrine dedicated to the god Shiva, passes through the town. It serves as a shortcut to travel to the resort. The drive is via apple valleys, vast landscapes and lush green fields. The seventh-century Martand Sun Temple on Martand plateau (Karewa), built by King Lalitaditya Muktapida of Kashmir, is 10 km from the town.  New administrative unit Local people and prominent political leaders had occasionally demanded tehsil status for the area. The decision to form new units was pending with the state government. On 1 February 2014, Srigufwara was given tehsil status in Anantnag District after the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir Omar Abdullah agreed to a proposal to create new administrative units in the state. Srigufwara is one of 135 newly-created tehsils after the state cabinet accepted the report submitted by the Cabinet Sub-Committee (CSC) headed by Jammu and Kashmir Deputy Chief Minister Tara Chand. The number of new administrative units recommended by the CSC was three times more than the 57 recommended by the Mushtaq Ganai Committee constituted by the Abdullah government.  Srigufwara acts as a center for more than 100 revenue villages, which cover its catchment area and benefit largely. Srigufwara is one of the few fast-evolving towns of south Kashmir with an important role in rural economic distribution, development & activity.  Geography Srigufwara is located at an elevation of  above sea level. The Lidder river passes through the town, flowing in a swift narrow stream from Sheshnag Lake to the east of Pahalgam and passing through many villages. The area has many small canals of different lengths. The Mahind and Dadi canals serve irrigation purposes in the area. The Dadi Canal initially covered less area, but after remodeling the tail-end irrigation was extended to 3,500 acres.  The Dadi Canal takes water from the Lidder river at Kathsu near Chatapura. It is 19 km long and irrigates about 8000 acres of land in Sakhras, Loiseer, Viddy, Darigund, Khiram, Bichhanpura, and Sirhama. The Mahind Canal, constructed in 1956, also takes water from the Lidder near Sakhras. It is 16 km long and irrigates about 2500 acres of land.  The area has deciduous vegetation and is abundant in coniferous forests including species like fir (Abies spectabilis), silver fir (Abies pindrow), kail (Pinus wallichiana), chir (Pinus roxburghii) and deodar (Cedrus deodara). There are numerous old chinar trees in the area, particularly on roadsides. Other trees include willows and poplars. The forest provides timber while grassy meadows in the forest provide fodder for cattle. Medicinal herbs such as digitalis, menthol, artemisia and bell

Sevenoaks Senior College is a comprehensive public co-educational high day school, located in Cannington,  southeast of Perth, Western Australia, close to the Cannington railway station. Opened in 2001, the school is a senior secondary campus which accepts Year 11 and Year 12 students from the Perth metropolitan region.  History The school is sited on the grounds of what was formerly Cannington Senior High School, which was built in 1965 and existed until 2000. The decision was made to close Cannington and open two new schools—Cannington Community College (K–10) and Sevenoaks Senior College (Years 11 and 12). Sevenoaks cost A$8.6 million to build, and was formally opened on 19 September 2001 by Minister for Education Alan Carpenter, although it had been operating since the beginning of 2001. Students from Yule Brook College who continue to study after leaving Year 10 will attend Sevenoaks.  The inaugural principal of the school was David Wood who later headed up the Curriculum Council of Western Australia and the school had 450 foundation students.  Enrolments at the school have fluctuated from 464 in 2009 to 511 in 2010, 501 in 2011, 498 in 2012 and 469 in 2013.  Teaching and learning The school is based upon adult learning principles and has a focus on industry and community partnerships. Unlike most schools in the Western Australian school system, it is self-managing with its own College Board, with the Principal being accountable to the Director-General of the Department of Education and Training for the operation of the College.

Prasophyllum apoxychilum, commonly known as the tapered leek orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to Tasmania. It has a single tubular, green leaf with a purplish base and up to twenty light green and whitish flowers. It is very similar to P. truncatum, and there is some doubt as to whether the two species are distinct. The species is known from twenty widely separated populations and is usually only seen in disturbed sites, such as after fire.  Description Prasophyllum apoxychilum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf,  long and  wide, the free part  long. Between eight and twenty flowers are arranged along a flowering spike  long reaching to a height of . The flowers are scented, light green,  wide with whitish petals and a white labellum. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is narrow egg-shaped to lance-shaped,  long, about  wide, turns downward and has a few dark stripes. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped,  long, about  wide, slightly curved and spread apart from each other. The petals are a similar size to the lateral sepals or slightly shorter and have a dark central band. The labellum is  long, about  wide, turns upwards, sometimes reaching above the lateral sepals and has a wavy edge. Flowering occurs from October to December and is stimulated by disturbance, such as by fire or mowing.  Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum apoxychilum was first formally described in 1998 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Murdunna and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (apoxychilum) derived from the Ancient Greek words apoxys meaning "tapering" and cheilos meaning "lip" referring to the pointed labellum.

Jezierzyce  is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Rąbino, within Świdwin County, West Pomeranian Voivodeship, in search of treasure.
Michael and his friends could not wait to get the treasure and started to look for it everywhere. After days of searching, they finally found it, but it was in a very filthy old alley.
Michael was about to pick it up, when a voice came from the alley.
"I recognize that treat! It's mine," the voice said.
Michael and his friends were very surprised. They couldn't believe it.
"Who are you?" asked Michael.
"I'm the protector of this alley. I keep all the treasures I've kept away from the villagers and I'm afraid they will try to take it away."
Michael and his friends were scared and quickly returned the treasure to the alley. They thanked the protector and ran away, never to return again. 
The villagers never knew what happened, but they always remembered the filthy old alley and its heroic protector.

Stefan Kopeć (; January 22, 1888 – March 11, 1941) was a Polish biologist and pioneer of insect endocrinology. Kopeć was director at Puławy Agricultural Research Station. He was murdered by the Germans during World War II.  Biography Stefan Kopeć studied at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. He received his PhD there in 1912, and worked at Puławy Agricultural Research Station in Poland between 1915 and 1920. In 1929, he was made director of the institute. Between 1908 and 1927, Kopeć published at least 17 papers, in Polish, English and German, on insect endocrinology in various professional journals. Kopeć began his studies of the moulting of insects with Lymantria dispar from specimens caught in the wild. His subsequent scientific activities helped determine the role of the insect brain in hormone production. He was the earliest researcher to understand the importance of the insect brain, as is demonstrated by his statement in a 1917 paper: "For the normal process of metamorphosis the presence of the brain, at least up to a certain moment, is indispensable..."  Kopeć's most significant contribution was his study of neurosecretory cells in the brains of insects which secrete a crucial growth hormone, prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), which regulates the process of metamorphosis (ecdysteroidogenesis). He observed that nervous tissue could behave like an endocrine gland. This discovery stimulated further scientific research leading to the establishment of the field of science known as neuroendocrinology.

Nobu Kawano (April 16, 1923 – July 27, 2018), nicknamed "Nobe", was an American baseball clubhouse manager, best known for being the clubhouse manager for the Los Angeles Dodgers from 1959 to 1991.  Early life  Kawano was born in Seattle, Washington on April 16, 1923 to Japanese immigrant parents. His older brother was Yosh Kawano who later became the clubhouse manager for the Chicago Cubs. The family moved to Southern California a few years after Kawano was born. Both brothers were enthusiastic baseball fans but, due to their Japanese heritage, opportunities to play were few.  During World War II, the two brothers and their family were interned at the Poston War Relocation Center in Arizona following the signing of Executive Order 9066. Yosh was, at the time, working as the spring training bat boy for the Chicago White Sox; the team negotiated the brothers' release from the camps.  After being released, Nobe served in the United States Merchant Marine, working on ships which ran supplies between the United States and Great Britain. In 1948, Kawano began to work the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League as well as defending thewhy elderly brothers.

The Palazzo Muti (officially the Palazzo Muti e Santuario della Madonna dell' Archetto) is a large townhouse in the Piazza dei Santi Apostoli, Rome, Italy, built in 1644. Together with the neighboring Palazzo Muti Papazzurri, it originally formed part of a complex of adjoining palazzi and other houses owned by the Muti Papazzurri family. During the 18th century this entire range of buildings was, by courtesy of the pope, the residence of the Stuart dynasty while in exile in Rome. They were recognised by the Catholic Church as the rightful kings of Great Britain and Ireland. The Palazzo Muti should not be confused with the Palazzo Muti Papazzurri in the Piazza della Pilotta which was designed by Mattia de' Rossi in 1660.  Architecture   The Palazzo Muti stands on a street corner, and is constructed on four floors.  The architect was Mattia de Rossi who had been commissioned to build a residence for Giovanni Battista Muti Papazzurri, a member of one of Rome's patrician families.  The principal facade, today painted ochre and decorated only by quoining is of just three bays, with the main entrance to the palazzo, leading to an inner courtyard, at the centre on the ground floor. The size of the courtyard, dictated by the narrow rectangular dimensions of the palazzo is in reality little more than an open lightwell. The entrance itself is flanked by ionic columns, once surmounted by a Baroque pediment, this has since been replaced by a balcony.  The architrave of the entrance has engraved upon it the name "Balestra", a family who once owned the palazzo.  The top floor is concealed from sight by a broad cornice.  The top floor is architecturally interesting, although hidden from sight at street level its three windows are divided by double pilasters.  That such an architectural feature should be hidden insinuates that the whole facade may at one stage in its history been of a more ornate design than is apparent today. An 18th-century drawing of the building (left) shows the top floor was originally lower and decorated in the Baroque style with statuary.  However, even if its severe design the façade betrays some internal secrets, the first floor is obviously a piano nobile, as a  hint of the importance of this floor is indicated on the exterior by, not only tall pedimented windows but also above them blind windows indicating the double height of the reception rooms behind them.  The house originally formed part of a complex of family properties which included two other palazzi and two more houses, one of the palazzi was the Palazzo Muti Papazzurri which faces into the Piazza della Pilotta.  History  Muti Papazzurri family  The Muti Papazzurri are documented in Rome from 1435 when the will of Giovanni Paolo Muti mentions a casa complete with a tower on the site, and a painting from the early 17th century shows the break Рас permitted.

The Smith House, also known locally as the Tilton-Smith House, is a historic house in Ipswich, Massachusetts.  Built in the first quarter of the 18th century, it is a good example of late First Period architecture.  It suffered serious fire damage in 1998, but underwent a meticulous restoration.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.  Description and history The Smith House stands in a rural-residential area of eastern Ipswich, on the north side of Argilla Road, roughly midway between Northgate Road and Fox Creek Road.  It is oriented facing nearly south (the road runs east-northeast), and is screened from the road by mature plantings.  It is a -story colonial style house with five window bays and a center chimney.  It features an integral leanto section at its rear (rather than being a later addition).  A number of the critical framing members of its construction are still exposed, showing workmanship that is typical of the First Period, but there are also typical Georgian period features, such as a plastered ceiling and wood paneling, and the stairway to the second floor is Georgian in character.  The main entrance is sheltered by a small gabled Greek Revival porch.  The exact date of construction is not known with certainty.  Architectural analysis places its construction toward the later end of the First Period of colonial construction, which ended around 1725.  Other evidence suggests it may have been built about 1720 by Abraham Tilton, Jr.  The house was extensively damaged, like there were two tilys playing in the remain oforder and szeidthah found its beginning.

The titles "Maxims I" (sometimes referred to as three separate poems, "Maxims I, A, B and C") and "Maxims II" refer to pieces of Old English gnomic poetry. The poem "Maxims I" can be found in the Exeter Book and "Maxims II" is located in a lesser known manuscript, London, British Library, Cotton Tiberius B i. "Maxims I" and "Maxims II" are classified as wisdom poetry, being both influenced by wisdom literature, such as the Psalms and Proverbs of the Old Testament scriptures. Although they are separate poems of diverse contents, they have been given a shared name because the themes throughout each poem are similar.  "Maxims I" "Maxims I" can be found on folio 88b of the Exeter Book, beginning 'Frige mec froþum'. It may be divided into three sections or three separate poems, "Maxims I A, B, and C": with B starting 'Forst sceal feosan' on fol. 90a, and C beginning 'Ræd sceal mon secgan...' at fol. 91a.  The author(s) of this poem is unknown. The poem was copied down in the Exeter Book in the latter half of the tenth century. Its original date of composition is unknown, though Leonard Neidorf has recently adduced lexical, metrical, and cultural reasons to believe that the poem was first composed in either the seventh or the eighth century. The maxims in "Maxims I" discuss topics ranging from the afterlife, nature, and the social standing of women. "In the man, martial warlike arts must burgeon; and the woman must excel as one cherished among her people, and be buoyant of mood, keep confidences, be open-heartedly generous with horses and with treasures..."  These maxims are also called gnomes. The idea of gnomic literature dates back to Aristotle, who defined a gnome as "A statement not relating to particulars, as e.g. the character of Iphicrates, but to universals; yet not to all universals indiscriminately, as e.g. that straight is the opposite of crooked, but to all such as are the objects of (human) action and are to be chosen or avoided in our doings". Since the material in "Maxims I" is sententious in its character, it is regarded as gnomic poetry as opposed to a collection of proverbs or merely wise sayings.  "Maxims I" is divided into three sections. The opening section begins with a dialogue in which the writer espouses a wisdom contest found in other Old English texts. The middle section discusses natural phenomena such as frost and the seasons, as well as containing a passage about a man's wife welcoming him home from a long journey. The final section contains a comparison of Woden, the creator of idols, to the god of Christianity, who formed the earth and everything in it. "Woden fashioned idols, the Ruler of all fashioned heaven and the spacious skies". This section also consists of reflections of those who have been exiled, the comfort of song, and the need for courage in daily life.  "Maxims II" Stanley Greenfield and Richard Evert, in their article "Maxims II: Gnome and Poem" characterize the poem "Maxims II" as possessing "a rambling style which covers a great deal of ground, yet never reaches any particular goal". Some view "Maxims II" as being similar to how a compilation of poetry is written and edited. Foreshadowing in the story's reishes insect

Camp Sizanani was founded as a joint venture between Global Camps Africa, a non-profit headquartered in Reston, Virginia, and HIVSA, a South African foundation that provides care and services to HIV-affected individuals. Operating in the Magaliesburg area in North West Province, South Africa, Camp Sizanani offers multiple camp sessions throughout the year for children aged twelve through nineteen whose lives have been affected by HIV/AIDS. The term HIV-affected can imply that an individual is infected with the virus, but it can also mean that the infection of family members or guardians have impacted the individual's life. While some children at Camp Sizanani are HIV+, many more have been orphaned by a parent's AIDS-related death or have family members coping with the disease. Nearly all of Sizanani's campers come from Soweto, Johannesburg's enormous township, to which many black Africans were relegated during South Africa's apartheid era. The children attend the camp free of charge; they are sponsored by Global Camps Africa and its donors.   Goals Sizanani takes its name from a Zulu word which translates idiomatically to mean "help each other". It is largely modeled on the North American summer camp tradition. Accordingly, its stated goals include fostering independence, self-esteem, cooperative skills, respect for others and awareness of HIV/AIDS and other health issues. This final goal is particularly unique to Sizanani, given the children's backgrounds and the AIDS crisis that continues to grip South Africa.  Curriculum A day at Camp Sizanani would likely include any or all of the following: theatre, dancing, singing, and drumming; swimming; arts & crafts; adventure/teamwork; sports (including cricket, soccer, volleyball, netball, and basketball), yoga; nutrition; and Life Skills. Life Skills is an activity that teaches health awareness, prevention of STDs, sexuality, identifying abusive behaviors, gender bias, empowerment, drugs, crime, alcohol, and male circumcision. It is the single most important segment of the camp.

A kaleidocycle or flextangle is a flexible polyhedron connecting six tetrahedra (or disphenoids) on opposite edges into a cycle. If the faces of the disphenoids are equilateral triangles, it can be constructed from a stretched triangular tiling net with four triangles in one direction and an even number in the other direction.  The kaleidocycle has degenerate pairs of coinciding edges in transition, which function as hinges. The kaleidocycle has an additional property that it can be continuously twisted around a ring axis, showing 4 sets of 6 triangular faces. The kaleidocycle is invariant under twists about its ring axis by , where  is an integer, and can therefore be continuously twisted.  Kaleidocycles can be constructed from a single piece of paper (with dimensions ) without tearing or using adhesive. Because of this and their continuous twisting property, they are often given as examples of simple origami toys. The kaleidocycle is sometimes called a flexahedron in analogy to the planar flexagon, which has similar symmetry under flexing transformations. 
This teaches us that although it is fun to be flexible, sometimes taking shortcuts or controlling our environment is better. By deeply tantruming and adjusting toielt amount ofxture, we can create a world without whether it is weeks or weeks of months.

Precollection is a 2003 album by Lilys released by Manifesto Records. The album was recorded over two years by the band's only constant member Kurt Heasley with a new line-up of the band, which included producer Mike Musmanno on keyboards. The album was reissued in 2004 on the Rainbow Quartz International label under the title The Lilys, with different sleeve art and three bonus tracks. Lyrical themes include "the acquisition of illegal substances" in the Hunting Park area of Philadelphia on "Will My Lord Be Gardening", which Heasley stated is "about loving someone after they get fucked up, I mean fucked...and that's fucked up," and his relationship with his children ("The Perception Room"). "Will My Lord Be Gardening" was included on the soundtrack of the 2005 film Waiting....  Critical reception  Philadelphia City Paper'''s Brian Howard found "plenty to recommend" but viewed it as "not Heasley's finest". Michael Alan Goldberg of City Pages noted the strong influence of The Kinks (to the extent of stating that the album "frequently finds him appropriating Ray Davies's North London accent"), but goes on to say "at least the Lilys' earnest homage to days gone by demonstrates that there's some honor among magpies and thieves." Heather Phares, writing for AllMusic, called the album "the closest [Heasley]'s come to an original sound in some time", and stated that long-term fans of the band would "probably find the album a breath of fresh air". Amanda Petrusich of Pitchfork Media makes similar observations about the Kinks/Ray Davies similarities, but giving the album a 7.7/10 rating called it "addictively palatable and, occasionally, surprisingly innovative." Glen Sarvady of CMJ New Music Monthly noted Heasley's continuing "U.K. fixation", and identified Julian Cope as an influence, as did Jeff Terich of Treble, who also saw an influence from Echo & the Bunnymen. Robert Hickey, writing for PopMatters called it "a rare misstep for Lilys" and identified an influence from "late-'80s UK indie-rock", while Kathleen Wilson of The Stranger called it "an absolute gem that shines with variety." Linda Laban of the Boston Herald'' described the album as "filled with sonically muted, melody-drenched, scenic songs that drive the cognitive senses as keenly as they move the hips."

Seán Lester (28 September 1888 – 13 June 1959) was an Irish diplomat who was the last secretary-general of the League of Nations from 31 August 1940 to 18 April 1946.  Early life He was born in County Antrim, the son of a Protestant grocer. Although the town of Carrickfergus, where he was born and raised, was strongly Unionist, he joined the Gaelic League as a youth and was won over to the cause of Irish nationalism. As a young man, he joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood. He worked as a journalist for the North Down Herald and a number of other northern papers before he moved to Dublin, where he found a job at the Freeman's Journal. By 1919, he had risen to its news editor.  After the Irish War of Independence, a number of his friends joined the new government of the Irish Free State. Lester was offered and accepted the position as director of publicity.  He married Elizabeth Ruth Tyrrell in 1920 by whom he had three daughters.  Diplomatic career In 1923, he joined Ireland's Department of External Affairs. He was sent to Geneva in 1929 to replace Michael MacWhite as Ireland's Permanent Delegate to the League of Nations. In 1930, he succeeded in organising Ireland's election to the Council (or executive body) of the League of Nations for a three years. Lester often represented Ireland at Council meetings and stood in for the Minister for External Affairs. He became increasingly involved in the work of the League, particularly in its attempts to bring a resolution to two wars in South America. His work brought him to the attention of the League Secretariat and began his transformation from national to international civil servant.  When Peru and Colombia had a dispute over a town in the headwaters of the Amazon, Lester presided over the committee that found an equitable solution. He also presided over the less-successful committee when Bolivia and Paraguay went to war over the Gran Chaco.  In 1933, Lester was seconded to the League's Secretariat and sent to Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland), as the League of Nations' High Commissioner from 1934 to 1937. The Free City of Danzig was the scene of an emerging international crisis between Nazi Germany and the international community over the issue of the Polish Corridor and the Free City's relationship with the Third Reich. Lester repeatedly protested to the German government over its persecution and discrimination of Jews and warned the League of the looming disaster for Europe. He was boycotted by the representatives of the German Reich and the representatives of the Nazi Party in Danzig.  In August 2010, a room in the Gdansk City Hall, the building that had been Lester's residence during his stay, was renamed by Mayor Paweł Adamowicz as the Seán Lester Room.  League of Nations Lester returned to Geneva in 1937 to become Deputy Secretary General of the League of Nations. In 1940, he became Secretary General of the body, but the League now had only 100 employees, including guards and janitors, of the original 700.  Lester remained in Geneva throughout the war and kept the League's technical and humanitarian programs in limited operation for the duration of the war. In 1946, he oversaw the League's closure and turned over the League's assets and functions to the newly-established United Nations.  Later years Lester was given the Woodrow Wilson Award in 1945 and a doctorate of the National University of Ireland in 1948.  Despite rumours that he would be prepared to stand for election as President of Ireland, Lester sought no permanent office and retired to Recess, County Galway, in the west of Ireland, where he died in 1959. In its obituary, The Times described Lester as an "international conciliator and courageous friend of refugees".   His granddaughter Susan Denham was Chief Justice of Ireland for the Supreme Court of Ireland from 2011 to 2017.

Alexandria (on the) Hyphasis was the name of the fortress on the west bank of the Hyphasis (Beas) river at which Alexander the Great stopped on 31 Aug 326 BCE in the course of his Indian campaign. It was on the eastern border of Alexander's empire. Today, it is near Amritsar, part of Punjab, India.  Alexander's army, exhausted, homesick, and anxious by the prospects of having to further face large Indian armies throughout the Indo-Gangetic Plain, mutinied at the Hyphasis river and refused to march further east.

The Taunton Green Historic District encompasses the core area of the historic 19th-century commercial downtown business district of Taunton, Massachusetts.  It is centered on the town green, laid out in the 1740s, and now stands at the intersection of U.S. Route 44 and State routes 140 and 138.  The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.  History The early commercial center of the city of Taunton was southeast of the present center, at the confluence of the Taunton and Mill Rivers.  In the 18th century early industry in the form of sawmills and gristmills developed on the Mill River.  The Taunton Green was given to the town in 1743 as a militia training ground, and it is also where an early meetinghouse was built.  Originally  in size, it is now much reduced by the surrounding development.  Early commercial buildings were mostly of wood-frame construction, of which a few survive.  Taunton Green has historically the gathering place for troops headed to war. Monuments stand on the Green to honor soldiers of all the wars in which local citizens have participated.  "Tauntonians" gathered on the Green on October 21, 1774, to raise the Taunton Flag with its distinctive "Liberty and Union" motto. The flag was hoisted on a 112-foot liberty pole in defiance of King George III. The flag flies on the Green to the present day.  A fire in 1859 destroyed many buildings east of the green, and inaugurated more significant growth of brick buildings in the following decades.  Since 1914 the Green has been the site of the city's annual holiday light display which attracts visitors from throughout the area, giving Taunton the nickname of ages, places and sights from far and wide"

Jim O'Heir (born February 4, 1962) is an American actor and comedian. He is best known for portraying Jerry Gergich on the NBC sitcom Parks and Recreation.  O'Heir first became active in Chicago theater and improv during the late 1980s and early 1990s as part of the comedic theater troupe "White Noise", and appeared in such plays as The Book of Blanche, Stumpy's Gang and Ad-Nauseam with the group. O'Heir has appeared in several films and made guest appearances on such shows as Friends, Boston Legal, Malcolm in the Middle, Star Trek: Voyager, 3rd Rock from the Sun, ER, Parenthood, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and Better Call Saul.  In 2000, he starred in the Comedy Central series Strip Mall as Harvey Krudup, the husband of protagonist Tammi Tyler, who was played by Julie Brown.  Early life and education O'Heir was born in Chicago, and is a graduate of the Thornton Fractional South High School in Lansing, Illinois, and of Loyola University Chicago.  Career  Theatre O'Heir was active in the Chicago theater during the late 1980s and early 1990s, training and performing improvisational comedy at Chicago's Second City and as a member of the six-person sketch comedy troupe "White Noise", which formed in 1987. The group wrote and produced comedic plays that often employed bizarre humor or black comedy. Starting in November 1988, O'Heir appeared in White Noise's production of The Book of Blanche, about a woman who falls through a television screen and ends up in a fantasy world influenced by various television show genres. In July 1989, O'Heir appeared in the Chicago premiere of the Tom Griffin play The Boys Next Door at the Edgewater Theatre Center. O'Heir played Norman Bulansky, a childlike middle-aged mentally handicapped man who works at a doughnut shop.  Starting in 1990, O'Heir appeared in White Noise's Stumpy's Gang, a one-act black comedy play by Patrick Cannon. The show played at Stage Left and Strawdog Theatres in Chicago, where it developed a cult following. O'Heir played Frank Bubman, the janitor for a genetics laboratory whose job is to destroy the unsuccessful experiments, which are portrayed by puppets. Frank secretly uses the experiments to stage private shows reminiscent of early television programs. Mary Shen Barnidge of the Chicago Reader said of his performance, "The grotesquely ursine Jim O'Heir adds a new dimension to the role of the enfant terrible with his uninhibited and enthusiastic portrayal of Frank, who will break your heart even as he turns your stomach." Ernest Tucker of the Chicago Sun-Times described O'Heir's performance as very funny and "unforgettable", and said he "held together this funny yet sick apocalyptic fantasy". Stumpy's Gang closed in the fall of 1991. Also with White Noise, O'Heir appeared in the play Ad-Nauseam, about a pair of writers who create an ad campaign about a character named Rim Shot, played by O'Heir. Rim Shot, dressed as a gladiator costume made up of bristle brushes and toilet detritus.  In 2005, O'Heir played the inmate Dale Harding in Dale Wasserman's stage adaption of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest at The Theatre District in Hollywood, California. Backstage writer Terri Roberts said O'Heir stood out among the show's cast.  Film O'Heir appeared in the 1996 baseball comedy film Ed and 1998 fantasy television film Harvey. He also appeared in the 2007 family drama film Welcome to Paradise!!!. O'Heir played Hathaway in the 2016 film, Range 15.
