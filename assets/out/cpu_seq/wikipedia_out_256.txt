Trachelyopterus insignis is a species of catfish from the freshwater driftwood catfish family, Auchenipteridae. It is commonly found in rivers of northern South America, where it is called the chivo (lit. "goat"), the rengue, or the doncella (lit. "maiden").  Taxonomy and naming The species was formally described in 1878 by the Austrian zoologist Franz Steindachner from Colombia's Rio Magdelena. Steindachner originally placed T. insignis in the genus Auchenipterus, another group of driftwood catfishes, and it has also been moved into Parauchenipterus, which is no longer considered valid.  Description  This catfish is sexually dimorphic. At a young age the sexes differ mainly in coloration; males are mottled, females are plain. Once sexual maturity is reached, however, males grow a large dorsal spine. Males can reach a 20 cm total length.  Distribution and habitat  T. insignis is exclusively freshwater and is endemic to the lower Rio Magdalena river basin of Colombia. It lives close to the bottom of whatever body of water it inhabits and prefers as pH range of 6.0–7.2 as well as water between , temperatures common for waters at tropical latitudes  It can be found in rivers of all sizes, as well as smaller creeks and floodplains.  Behavior Like many other members of the driftwood store to tackle and its surrounding family.

Megachile ypiranguensis is a species of bee in the family Megachilidae. It was described by Schrottky in 1913. Megachant's mommy and daddy smiled and laughed as they watched her beaming with joy.
Megachile took big breaths of fresh air and enjoyed the freshness of the air. She could see the birds and insects in the garden and she heard the music of the rain pouring down from the sky. Megach wondered what it would be like to fly and explore the world. 
Suddenly, Megachil heard a loud noise coming from the sky. She looked up and saw a plane zooming above her. She was so excited that she started to scream in happiness. The plane flew over the windows and Megachil waved goodbye to it.
As Megachil was running back to her house, she felt a chill in the air. She shivered and hugged her mommy tight. She realised that the air outside was cold and everything was starting to freeze. Megachil hugged her mommy even tighter to keep warm and smiled at her mommy's amazing new ear. 
Megachil was so excited that she could hardly contain herself. She had experienced a new adventure and it was the best feeling ever. Megachil was happy to be back home where it was warm and normal.

The Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO) is a non-profit research and campaign group whose declared aim is to "expose any effects of corporate lobbying on EU policy making". It is based in Brussels.  The team (2021) consists of 13 staff members.  Areas of work   EU decisions and policies often mirror the interests of big business, as a result of the corporate capture of EU decision-making processes. This has consequences in terms of social and economic injustice and inequality, climate change and environmental destruction. Thus, CEO has developed a particular expertise in the following EU policy areas: agriculture, food safety, energy, climate change, EU lobbying regulation, trade, investment, economy, and finance.   Corporate Europe Observatory's reports often attract the attention of media from all over the world. Recently, it gained international attention by announcing (in a joint publication with Global Witness and Corporate Accountability) that at COP26 the fossil fuel industry had the largest delegation at the summit.  With French NGO Observatoire des multinationales, CEO issued a report on Emmanuel Macron's French Presidency of the EU Council which shows how the French EU Presidency had been prepared closely with the industry, raising several democratic concerns.  CEO's work as a lobby watchdog of big pharma and big tech, has also issued significant reports, which were published in The New York Times, and Reuters.  Working in coalitions  Corporate Europe Observatory carries out research and publishes reports on corporate lobbying activities at the EU level.  CEO is one of the founders of the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency and Ethics Regulation (ALTER-EU). This coalition of over 160 civil society groups, trade unions, academics and public affairs firms monitors the influence of lobbyists on the political agenda in Europe.  In 2010 ALTER-EU published "Bursting the Brussels Bubble". This collection of articles provides an insight into decision-making in the European Union and explores some lobbying techniques.  CEO jointly organises the Worst EU Lobbying Awards, which are given to the lobby group, which uses "the most deceptive, misleading or otherwise problematic lobbying tactics in their attempts to influence EU decision-making" in a given year.

The National Day for Truth and Reconciliation (sometimes shortened to T&R Day) (NDTR; ), originally and still colloquially known as Orange Shirt Day (), is a Canadian holiday to recognize the legacy of the Canadian Indian residential school system.   NDTR is a statutory holiday for:   federal government employees and private-sector employees to whom the Canada Labour Code applies;  provincial government employees in Manitoba and Nova Scotia;  all workers in British Columbia, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Prince Edward Island, and Yukon.  Orange Shirt Day was first established as an observance in 2013, as part of an effort to promote awareness and education of the residential school system and the impact it has had on Indigenous communities for over a century. The impact of the residential school system has been recognized as a cultural genocide.  The use of an orange shirt as a symbol was inspired by the accounts of Phyllis Jack Webstad, whose personal clothing—including a new orange shirt—was taken from her during her first day of residential schooling, and never returned. The orange shirt is thus used as a symbol of the forced assimilation of Indigenous children that the residential school system enforced.  The day was elevated to a statutory holiday for federal workers and workers in federally-regulated workplaces by the Parliament of Canada in 2021, and named "National Day for Truth and Reconciliation", in light of the claims of over 1,000 unmarked graves near former residential school sites.  Background  Indian residential school system   Shortly after Confederation in 1867, the ministers in the new Cabinet of Canada inherited the responsibility of advising the Crown on the treaties signed between it and the First Nations of Canada. Prime Minister John A. Macdonald was faced with a country with disparate cultures and identities and wanted to forge a new Canadian identity to unite the country and ensure its survival. It was Macdonald's goal to absorb the First Nations into the general population of Canada and extinguish their culture. In 1878, he commissioned Nicholas Flood Davin to write a report about residential schools in the United States. One year later, Davin reported that only residential schools could separate aboriginal children from their parents and culture and cause them "to be merged and lost" within the nation. Davin argued that the government should work with the Christian churches to open these schools.  Beginning in 1883, the government began funding Indian residential schools across Canada, which were run primarily by the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Church; but also included the United Church of Canada, the Methodist Church, and the Presbyterian Church. When the separation of children from their parents was resisted, the government responded by making school attendance compulsory in 1894 and theHTTP"])]{cles were avoided by theՀ學ists called K dd ^{.

The Manglabites or Manglavites (, manglabitai; sing. μαγ[γ]λαβίτης, manglabitēs) were a corps of bodyguards in the Byzantine Empire.  Etymology Their name derives from the term manglabion (μαγγλάβιον, "cudgel") which was also used to designate the entire corps. The origin of the term itself is debated: one theory regards it as deriving from Arabic mijlab ("whip"), while another from Latin manus ("hand") and clava ("cudgel").

The gnatcatchers are a family of small passerine birds called Polioptilidae. The 21 species occur in North and South America (except for the far south and the high Andean regions). Most species of this mainly tropical and subtropical group are resident, but the blue-grey gnatcatcher of the United States and southern Canada migrates south in winter. They are close relatives of the wrens.  Description These dainty birds are intermediate between Old World warblers and wrens in their structure and habits, moving restlessly through foliage seeking insects. The gnatcatchers are mainly soft bluish grey in colour, and have the typical insectivore's long sharp bill. Many species have distinctive black head patterns (especially males) and long, regularly cocked, black-and-white tails. The skulking gnatwrens are browner, more thickset, and with proportionally shorter tails and longer bills.  Distribution and habitat They are distributed from North to South America, with the exception of the far south and high Andean regions. Gnatwrens typically occur in the undergrowth of dense, often humid, forest, while gnatcatchers, depending on the species involved, occur in anything from dry scrubby habitats (e.g. the California gnatcatcher) to the canopy of humid Amazonian forest (e.g. the Guianan gnatcatcher). The North American species nest in bushes or trees, but the breeding behavior of several of the Neotropical species is essentially unknown.  Taxonomy and systematics  A species new to science, the critically endangered Iquitos gnatcatcher Polioptila clementsi, was first described in 2005. This species is a member of the Baby feeders codeed by Mother, Motheriindeer and baconan,cial Snackser.

TwinBee 3: Poko Poko Daimaō{{efn|{{nihongo|TwinBee 3: Poko Poko Daimaō|ツインビー ポコポコ大魔王|Tsuinbī Surī Poko Poko Daimaō|lit. The Great Demon King Poko Poko}}}} is a vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up video game produced by Konami originally released for the Family Computer in 1989. It was the third game in the TwinBee series released for the Famicom, following the home version of the original TwinBee and the Famicom-exclusive Moero TwinBee. Unlike Moero, which was released in North America as Stinger, TwinBee 3 was a Japan-only release. It was re-released on April 14, 2006 as part of the i-Revo downloadable game service.TwinBee 3 ditches the side-scrolling stages from Stinger and only features top-scrolling ones similar to the original. Moreover, the game lacks the 3-Player mode from Moero, allowing only up to two players. The game is considerably easier than its predecessors due to an option mode that allows players to adjust the difficulty and number of ships, as well as the inclusion of the new "soul reviving system", which allows players to recover their power-ups after losing a ship.  The game uses digitized PCM voice samples, particularly when the conga music in one stage chants "Poko Poko", and in the beginning of each stage, in which a voice proclaims the name of the stage.  Characters TwinBee The default Player 1 aircraft, colored blue, Twinbee can fire up to two shots rapidly and has a barrier durability of ten shots. WinBee The default Player 2 aircraft, colored red, Winbee can fire up to four shots rapidly and has a barrier durability of fifteen shots. GwinBee A green-colored aircraft and the baby brother of TwinBee and WinBee. He was kidnapped by Poko Poko during an errand.  In the instruction manual of Detana TwinBee Yahho!

Freshwater is a national park in Queensland, Australia,  34 km north of Brisbane. The park is west of Redcliffe, near Deception Bay, within Caboolture Shire.  The park's vegetation is a remnant of the Open Sclerophyll Woodland which was once common in this area. The dominant trees are Eucalyptus species, notably scribbly gum - Eucalyptus racemosa with smooth white trunks, and some Angophora species, while the shrub layer varies from an Open Heath area dominated by low grasstrees in the south of the park to dense Casuarina stands, and small swampy areas with paperbark trees (Melaleuca sp.). A small creek runs through the north end of the park.  Sighted in the Open Heath area are low growing plants such as the fringed lilly Thysanotus tuberosus, tall sundew Drosera peltata, which is a carnivorous plant, flat-stemmed cord rush Eurychorda complanata and Wallum grevillea Grevillea leiophylla, which is a delicate pink flowered grevillea growing to only about 30 cm. This is only a small selection of the numerous beautiful plants to be found in the afternoon afternoon.

"Rain" is the seventeenth single by Japanese pop singer-songwriter Yui. It was released on November 24, 2010. The title song is a tie-in for the Fuji TV drama series Perfect Report. The single reached number 2 on the Oricon chart.  Music video and lyrics   The music video for "Rain" alternates between cuts of Yui and her band playing in the rain and Yui herself running through a rainy street towards a Christmas gift shop. Around the middle of the music video, a happier past is shown through flashbacks of Yui smiling and receiving earrings on a sunny day, along with the lines: "They try to bring back memories / Which are already gone / No matter what I do, I can't get rid of the past." The video eventually ends with an image of hope for the future, with the lyrics: "When someday this rain turns to rainbow then our lives will be filled with happiness!"
This story shows that even in difficult times, it's possible to make history without meaning to. With a little help from others, we can make the world a little brighter.
R Peace weeded the story, and at the end of the story is that it's all about adding love and kindness to our lives. As we add love and generosity to our lives, our happiness will always be a reminder of the past.

An American Tail: Fievel's Gold Rush is a platform game that was first released in Europe on March 1, 2002, for the Game Boy Advance, then in North America on May 2, 2003. Based on Universal Studios' An American Tail animated feature film franchise, the game was developed by Hokus-Pokus<ref name="mobygames">{{Cite web |title='An American Tail: Fievel's Gold Rush at MobyGames |url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/an-american-tail-fievels-gold-rush |access-date=2021-02-01 |website=MobyGames |archive-date=2021-01-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210124225903/https://www.mobygames.com/game/an-american-tail-fievels-gold-rush |url-status=live}}</ref> and published by Conspiracy Entertainment.   Gameplay  Players control series protagonist Fievel Mousekewitz, a rodent with an immigration card, in a traditional side-scrolling platformer as he travels West through 18 levels and six worlds, including "New York City" and "Gold Dust Gulch", to piece together Cat Malone's treasure map. Fievel will swing on rope, attack with his ten-gallon hat, ride riverboats, and jump the train to find Wylie Burp's gold. Fievel's goal is to rescue his kidnapped family members and friends as well as to find the gold.  Conspiracy Entertainment published the game for a "young audience who loved the films and direct-to-video sequels".   Reception   The game received mediocre reviews from critics. French website Jeuxvideo.com'' wrote that "it takes a real pleasure to play in an environment so worked. The levels are quite varied and different to want to continue. The characters are very fine and loyal to the cartoon. The animation is very fluid. You will never be hampered by a slowdown and this regardless of the number of enemies displayed[...] particular attention was brought to the soundtrack. It is really very good quality and quite adapted to crossed levels. But there also are somewhat regretted the lack of diversity in the music". The publication pointed out that the title appeals to younger players due in part to the game's short length.

The Pendlebury Library of Music is the library of the Faculty of Music, University of Cambridge, England. The current building was completed in 1984, and was designed by Sir Leslie Martin. The library is located next to the West Road Concert Hall and the Faculty of Music's old building on the Sidgwick Site, West Road, Cambridge. The current classification system is somewhat similar to the one used for music at Cambridge University Library's Music Collections, and has a basic classification approach of a three-digit number. The library is open to all members of the university.  History The library is named after Richard Pendlebury who had donated his collection of printed sheet music and manuscripts to the Fitzwilliam Museum, from where most of it was eventually transferred to Cambridge University Library. In 1929 this collection was given to the Music Faculty, and then the name "The Pendlebury Library of Music" was used. In 1994 all music manuscripts were transferred to Cambridge University Library. Pendlebury's original collection of printed sheet music is still accessible at the Pendlebury Library of Music.

Jérémy Gabriel (born December 10, 1996), also known as Le Petit Jérémy, is a French Canadian singer.  Biography Gabriel was born in Charlesbourg, Quebec City. At birth he was deaf, and had head, facial, ear and skull deformities. At age 6 months he was diagnosed with Treacher Collins syndrome. At age 5 years he was referred to Shriners Hospitals for Children where he met with Dr. Lucie Lessard. At age 6 (2003) he received a bone anchored hearing aid and discovered his passion for singing. In 2006 he sang for the Pope. In 2011, he sang the Canadian National Anthem, "O Canada", for a Montreal Canadiens NHL game.  After performing before pope Benedict XVI in 2006, he was received by Cardinal Ouellet and awarded the decoration of the Pontifical Swiss Guard. He performed several songs at CanadaFest between the years of 2007, 2011 and 2012 CanadaFest.  During 2012–2013, Gabriel became one of the co-patients ambassadors of the Shriners Hospitals for Children. He performed for several congresses and Shrine events across North America. He sang in Toronto, London, Montreal, Calgary, Ottawa, Chatham-Kent, Regina, Atlanta, Lewiston, Charlotte, Tampa Bay, Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles and Las Vegas.  Gabriel's parents filed a complaint with the Quebec human rights commission against Mike Ward for jokes Ward performed in regards to Gabriel's handicap and singing, in his shows from 2010 to 2013. The commission brought the case in front of Quebec's Human Rights Tribunal seeking $80,000 in damages from Ward. The tribunal ordered Ward to pay him $35,000 and his mother $7000 in July 2016. Ward's attorney, Julius Grey, appealed the decision. The decision was upheld by appellate court judges on November 28, 2019. Ward appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, which on October 29, 2021, ruled that Ward had not incited hatred against Gabriel, and overturned the tribunal's decision.  On February 1, 2022, Gabriel and his mother sued Mike Ward for libel, asking for over $300,000 in damages.  On September 30, 2016, Gabriel released his first single, 'I Don't Care', on JLMMUSIC. That release is distributed by DEP and Believe Digital, and supported by Universal Music Canada. An extended play is scheduled for 2017.

The Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives is the presiding officer of the Louisiana House of Representatives, the lower house of the Louisiana State Legislature. The speaker serves as the leader and head of the Louisiana House. The speaker is traditionally suggested by the Governor of Louisiana. The speaker's counterpart in the State Senate is the President of the Senate, currently Republican Patrick Page Cortez.  History  The first speaker, Pierre Bauchet St. Martin, was elected by the House in 1812. During the first years of statehood the speakership and the Louisiana House of Representative was dominated by supporters of Henry Clay, after 1845 the Democratic Party came to dominate politics until the United States Civil War. After the war the state, along with the rest of the southern states, underwent the Reconstruction from 1865 until 1877, during this time politics were dominated by the Republican Party. In 1877 the Democrats came to power again and stayed in power in the House until late 2010. During this time the practice of the Governor appointing the speaker began. In 2008 Republican Governor Bobby Jindal appointed the first Republican speaker in over a hundred years even though the Democrats held a small majority.  When Democrat John Bel Edwards succeeded Jindal in 2016, his choice as Speaker, Democrat Walt Leger III of New Orleans, was rejected by house's Republican majority, which instead elected fellow Republican Taylor Barras of New Iberia.

A Late Picking : Poems 1965-1974 (1975) is the collection of poems by Australian poet A. D. Hope. It was published in hardback by Angus and Robertson in Sydney in 1975.   The anthology includes 39 poems by the author.  Contents  Critical reception Geoff Page writing in The Canberra Times noted that the collection "in general confirms long-held impressions of Hope: the dry detached amusement, the steady quatrains, 'the long isolation of the heart', the erudition (both scientific and literary), the old man still savouring sensual joys. A few poems set you back slightly. They're still Hope but in genres you wouldn't have thought his temperament would come to: for example, 'Hay Fever', (a kind of carpe diem poem which almost becomes a pastoral lyric); an elegy for Osip Mandelstam (an artist one would not have thought much to Hope's Augustan tastes); 'Winterreise' (a straight medieval lyric) or 'Dialogue' (a placid accepting love poem in no way touched with either irony or sexual energy)."

Melanin Man is an album by the Jamaican musician Mutabaruka, released in 1994. Mutabaruka supported the album with a North American tour that included shows with Speech. "Bone Lie" was a hit in Jamaica.  Production The album was produced by Mutabaruka, Gussie Clarke, and Philip "Fatis" Burrell. Sly and Robbie played on Melanin Man; Dennis Brown, Cocoa Tea, and Freddie McGregor sang on the album.   The title track alludes to the pseudoscientific theory; it was also considered a black pride anthem. "Beware" offers advice to Nelson Mandela. "Miss Lou" is addressed to Louise Bennett-Coverley.  Critical reception  The Washington Post opined that "the unimaginative, mechanical dancehall rhythms and dub echoes pander to all the worst musical stereotypes and Mutabaruka's verse is all strident polemics full of abstract nouns with none of the sensual imagery and fresh metaphor of such musical Caribbean poets as Bob Marley and Shinehead."

Halls Hill is a community about 20 kilometres northeast of Sackville, New Brunswick, Benny's Dad. One day, it was really hot and they were all very thirsty. 
Mom asked the friends, "Do you want a drink?" 
Benny said, "I would love some butter."
Mom said, "We don't have any butter. What can I do?" 
Benny thought for a moment. Then he said, "I know! We can go to the store and buy some butter." 
So, the friends went to the store. They saw lots of different kinds of butter. Some were thick and some were thin. Finally, they chose a big, thick jar of butter. 
The friends brought the butter home and they all enjoyed their cold, thick butter. 
They were very happy and thanked Benny for his idea.

Machpelah Cemetery is a Jewish cemetery located within the Cemetery Belt in Glendale, Queens, in the U.S. state of New York. It was established around 1855. In addition to managing the  cemetery, the former Machpelah Cemetery Association also managed the adjacent Union Field Cemetery, New Union Field Cemetery and Hungarian Union Field Cemetery. Machpelah Cemetery was abandoned by the late 1980s. The deteriorating entrance building was demolished in 2013.  It is accessible by the New York City Subway's  via the Cypress Hills station and the B13 New York City Bus.  Houdini's grave Machpelah Cemetery is the final resting place of magician Harry Houdini, his brother Theodore Hardeen, his mother, father, grandfather, four other brothers, and a sister. Houdini's widow Bess, who died of a heart attack in 1943, had wished to be buried next to her husband, but instead was interred 35 miles north at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Westchester County, as her Catholic family refused to allow her to be buried in a Jewish cemetery.  During October 1969, the 43rd anniversary of Houdini's death was celebrated on Halloween by The Spellbinder, the Society of American Magicians. Among the members of the society's New York Chapter were one-hundred Long Island Magicians, who went to Houdini's grave at Machpelah Cemetery to hold memorial services for the famed escape artist.  Although born Erich Weiss, he changed his name to Harry Houdini at the age of 17. He chose this name because admired the French magician Robert Houdin. There were rumors concerning that there was a secret compartment at Houdini's grave in Queens. In addition, some people believe this cemetery, near Houdini grave, holds a secret compartment: this compartment, revealed by a hidden device, was said to be where dark secrets are waiting to be discovered. Magic historian and Houdini biographer Milbourne Christopher, during an interview, said he did not believe that such a compartment existed and that Houdini would never communicate from beyond the grave; then he said that it might be possible.  The Machpelah Cemetery was visited by many figures. David Copperfield, perhaps the world's best-known contemporary magician, paid his respects at Harry Houdini's grave site. Furthermore, Copperfield donated $15,000 to the Society of American Magicians in order to help undo an act of vandalism which desecrated several graves, along with Houdini's, after speaking with the Society of American Magician's Chairman John Bohannon. Along with Copperfield's donation, the escape artist James Randi donated $2,000, and $8,000 were donated from magicians all over the world; these donations paid for the replacement of two granite benches that were vandalized in 1993 and for casting a permanent Houdini bust.  George Schindler, the dean of the Society of American Magicians, said his group had stopped contributing money toward the maintenance of the site in recent years. "[Cemetery administrator] David Jacobson sends us a bill for upkeep every year but we never pay it." "The Society of American Magicians never paid the cemetery for any restoration of the Houdini family plot in my tenure since 1988," Jacobson said.  The money came from the dwindling funds of the Machpelah Cemetery, he said.  The Society of American Magicians performed a "broken wand" ritual on October 31, 1996, the anniversary of Houdini's death. This ritual in which a "magic wand" is broken symbolizes the end of the magician's power.  The granite monuments of Houdini's sister, Gladys, and brother, Leopold, are missing. Some members of the society say they believe that Jacobson has hidden them, or worse, sold them off to collectors. "I have them," Jacobson has said. "They are broken." The Houdini grave site is no longer cared for by the Society of American Magicians, but by The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  A bust of Harry Houdini was smashed or stolen four times from his family plot at Machpelah between 1975 and 1

The Meunier rifle, known as the "Meunier A6" or "STA No. 8", evolved as a part of the program initiated in 1890 by the French military to develop a semi-automatic infantry rifle that would eventually replace the Mle 1886–93 Lebel rifle. Four government research establishments (STA, ENT, Puteaux and CTV) proposed over 20 prototypes. About half of them were based on recoil (both short recoil and long recoil) and the others were gas operated. This secret program was placed under the direction of General Naquet-Laroque who headed the Puteaux (APX) government arsenal.  History Shortly after the adoption of the Lebel 1886 and its revolutionary ammunition, two brothers, Clair, built a semi-automatic shotgun in 1888, an 8 mm semi-auto pistol in 1892, and prototypes of semi-auto rifles were made in 1894. In addition, the adoption in 1888 of the German Kommissions Gewehr with its rimless cartridge had shown the obsolete design of the French 8×50mm rimmed case. Programs were initiated to design a new cartridge and a new rifle.  Cartridge development The Section Technique de l'Artillerie (STA) developed various rimless high performance cartridges from 1890 to 1912. Among these cartridges, some were retained:   6×58 Meunier 1897  6×60 ENT, 1900  6.5×60 CAP 1905  6.5×61 STA 1910  6.5×55.5 Berthier 1910  7×59 STA 1912  7×57 Meunier 1912  Rifle development Between 1894 and 1913, there was a fierce competition to develop a new rifle. They were tested by:   Section Technique de l'Artillerie, Artillery Technical Section aka STA   Rifle A 1 later redesigned as Rifle A 4  Rifle A 2 STA 5  Rifle A 3 STA 6  Carbine A 4  Rifle A 5 STA 7  Rifle A 6 STA 8  (7mm Meunier rifle)   Ecole Normale de Tir, National Shooting School aka ENT   Rifle B 1, ENT 1901, system Rossignol  Rifle B 2, System Rossignol  Rifle B 3, ENT 1902, system Belgrand  Rifle B 4, system Rossignol  Rifle B 5, system Rossignol  Rifle B 6, system Belgrand  Rifle B 7, system Chezaud  Rifle B 8, system Vallarnaud   Commission Technique de Versailles, Versailles Technical Commission aka CTV  Etablissement Technique de Puteaux, Puteaux Technical Section aka APX.

Mathías Leonardo Vidangossy Rebolledo (born 25 May 1987) is a Chilean professional footballer who currently plays for Unión La Calera as an attacking midfielder or winger.  Club career Born in Santiago, Vidangossy began his career in the youth squads of Club Deportivo Universidad Católica, but finished his football grooming at Unión Española. He made his Chilean Primera División debuts in 2005, and became a constant feature in the starting lineups.  In June 2007, Vidangossy was signed to a five-year contract with Villarreal CF in Spain, joining compatriots Manuel Pellegrini (coach) and Matías Fernández. However, he would never play any official games for the club, as all of its foreign player spots were used up; he was quickly loaned out to fellow La Liga team UD Almería, but met the same fate.  Vidangossy was subsequently loaned to Chilean club Audax Italiano, which played in the 2008 edition of the Copa Libertadores. Afterwards, he stayed in the country and also on loan, now to Everton de Viña del Mar.  On 23 June 2009, Vidangossy was confirmed as a new Ñublense player, but he was released after only two months, momentarily retiring from football. He joined Ceará Sporting Club of the Brazilian Série A on 17 February 2010 but, shortly after, he returned to his country and signed for San Luis Quillota.  Vidangossy subsequently represented, in quick succession and always in the Chilean top flight, Deportes La Serena, Colo-Colo, Unión Española and Club Deportivo Palestino. On 27 August 2015, he was loaned by the latter side to Chiapas FC, who had the option to make the move permanent.  International career In 2007, Vidangossy was selected to play for the Chilean under-20 team in the 2007 South American Youth Championship that took place in Paraguay. There, he scored twice against Bolivia.  The nation went on to qualify for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup that took place in Canada: in the quarter-finals against Nigeria, Vidangossy netted the last goal in a 4–0 extra time as the team eventually finished third, their best-ever performance in the category.

The Vitim (; , ; , ;  Buryat and , Vitim) is a major tributary of the Lena. Its source is east of Lake Baikal, at the confluence of rivers Vitimkan from the west and China from the east. The Vitim flows first south, bends eastwards and then northward in the Vitim Plateau. Then it flows north through the Stanovoy Highlands and the town of Bodaybo. Including river Vitimkan, its western source, it is  long, and has a drainage basin of .    It is navigable from the Lena to Bodaybo. Upstream, tugs can haul barges as far as the Baikal Amur Mainline (BAM), but this is becoming rare.    The Vitim is an excellent place for adventure rafting, but is rarely visited because of its isolation. Baissa, one of the famous localities of fossil insects is situated on the left bank of the Vitim River.  History The first Russian to explore the river was probably Maksim Perfilyev in 1639–40, who brought back reports of the upper Amur River. Formerly, because of its swift current, goods were hauled  overland from Chita to Romanovka. There boats were built, floated down the river, and broken up at their destination. This lasted until the late 1940s.  The Vitim event occurred in the Vitim River basin near Bodaybo on 25 September 2002. The event was probably caused by a bolide. The event was similar to Tagish Lake.  Course  Going upstream: Vitim town where the Vitim joins the Lena. Mama and Mama Airport, about  south of Vitim. A muscovite mica mine from 1705 until the late 1930s.  Now a small settlement. Mamakan, on a west-flowing stretch  south-southeast of Vitim. In 1963 a 86MW dam on the Mamakan River was completed, one of the first dams built on permafrost. Bodaybo, just upstream, a gold mining center founded in 1864.  Upstream, the port of Luzhki was the start of a road to the Lena gold fields. From here upstream the river goes crookedly east and then south. About  upstream from Bodaybo are the Delyun-Uran Rapids and after  more, the Parama Rapids. About  or so upstream, the Vitim is crossed by the Baikal Amur Mainline between Taksimo and Kuanda. Upriver there are more rapids and goldfields. South through the Stanovoy Mountains

The Kids Are Alright () is a 2021 Spanish comedy film directed by Santiago Segura which stars Segura himself and Leo Harlem. It is a remake of the French film Attention au départ!.  Plot  Ricardo is charged with accompanying his son, along a group of kids, to a camp in Asturias. Felipe, the grand father of one of the latter, also goes alongside him. However, both end up missing the train, leaving the kids in their own way.  Cast  Production   Written by the director Santiago Segura alongside Marta González de Vega, the film is a remake of the 2021 French film , which actually hit the French theatres later than the Spanish release. The Kids are Alright was produced by Bowfinger International Pictures and Atresmedia Cine in collaboration with , Todos Al Tren La Película A.I.E. and Glow, with participation of Atresmedia and Movistar+.  Shooting took place in Asturias (including Illas, Avilés and ), but footage was also shot in locations of the province of Toledo (Illescas) and the Madrid region.  The film's original song, Tu tren, was performed by Carlos Jean and Bebe.  Release  Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures España, the film was theatrically released in Spain on 8 July 2021. It became the highest-grossing Spanish film of 2021.  Reception  Rubén Romero Santos of Cinemanía gave the film 2 out of 5 stars. Lacking in creativity and displaying characters' indefinition, he found the kids' subplot to be a drag, to the point of "turning the viewer into a little Herod". He also found worrying the turn of the filmmaking career of Santiago Segura, having become an adaptator of inane family comedy films.  Fausto Fernández of Fotogramas gave it 4 out of 5 stars, praising the situations which the Leo Harlem's character set the rest of characters in. He considered both of the two film subplots to work fine: that of the kids in the train, and particularly the complementary one (a sort of road movie).  Raquel Hernández Luján of HobbyConsolas gave the film 45 out of 100 points, considering it to be a clone of previous Segura's proposals, praising the character performed by David Guapo, while decrying the cringeful jokes related to inclusive language and machismo, and overall the stale tone of the film.  Josu Eguren of El Correo gave the film 1 out of 3 stars, considering it fell short in terms of comedy. He pointed out at the film separating the gags dedicated to a child audience and those dedicated to an adult audience, with the "weak group of brats" on one side and the part led by Segura, Harlem and Guapo on the other side.

Gösta Ingvar Carlsson (born 9 November 1934) is a Swedish politician who twice served as Prime Minister of Sweden, first from 1986 to 1991 and again from 1994 to 1996. He was leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party from 1986 to 1996. He is best known for leading Sweden into the European Union.  Carlsson was a member of the Riksdag from 1965 to 1996 representing the constituency of Stockholm County (until 1970 in the lower house). He served as Minister of Education from 1969 to 1973, as Minister of Housing in 1973 and again from 1974 to 1976, and as Minister of Environmental affairs from 1985 to 1986. He served as Deputy Prime Minister from 1982 to 1986, and assumed office as Prime Minister of Sweden upon the assassination of Prime Minister Olof Palme in 1986.  Early life  Carlsson was born in Borås, Västra Götaland County (then Älvsborg County), Sweden and is the third son of the warehouse worker Olof Karlsson and Ida, née Johansson. Carlsson has a diploma in business economics and a degree in political science from Lund University. In Lund he met with Tage Erlander, the Swedish prime minister, and his aide Olof Palme, later to become Erlander's successor. He graduated in 1952.  Early political career   After finishing studies Carlsson got a job in Erlander's staff, along with other young aides such as Palme and Bengt K. Å. Johansson. Erlander called this group "the boys". In 1965, Carlsson attended Northwestern University in Illinois in the United States as a Fulbright scholar studying economics. After returning home, he was elected member of the Swedish Parliament. In the same year, he also became leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League. He had the following ministerial posts: Minister of Education 1969-1973, Minister of Housing 1973-1976, Deputy Prime Minister 1982-1986.  He was deputy prime minister to Prime Minister Olof Palme when Palme was assassinated.  Prime Minister  First premiership (1986-1991)  Following the assassination of Olof Palme in 1986, Ingvar Carlsson became the new Prime Minister or Statsminister and party leader. Together with Minister for Finance Kjell-Olof Feldt, the government turned a budget deficit of 90 billion SEK to a surplus of a few hundred billion SEK, which initially led to large investments and record low unemployment.  1980s Social Democratic neoliberal measures—such as depressing and deregulating the currency to prop up Swedish exports during the economic restructuring transition, dropping corporate taxation and taxation on high income-earners, and switching from anti-unemployment policies to anti-inflationary policies—were exacerbated by international recession, unchecked currency speculation, and a centre-right government led by Carl Bildt (1991–1994), creating the fiscal crisis of the early 1990s.  But Sweden's economy began to deteriorate in the early 1990s. In 1990 the Carlsson cabinet resigned after failing to gain a majority for its economic policy agenda, but was reinstated immediately with a slightly changed agenda.  In 1987, he visited United States President Ronald Reagan at the White House, becoming the first Swedish prime minister to visit a U.S. president since Erlander met John F. Kennedy in 1961.  Second premiership (1994-1996) The Social Democrats lost the elections in 1991, but Carlsson returned to power after the elections in 1994. When the Social Democrats returned to power in 1994, they responded to the fiscal crisis by stabilizing the currency—and by reducing the welfare state and privatizing public services and goods, as governments did in many countries influenced by Milton Friedman, the Chicago Schools of political and economic thought, and the neoliber

Carl Michael Edwards Jr. (born August 15, 1979) is an American former professional stock car racing driver. He last competed in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, driving the No. 19 Toyota Camry for Joe Gibbs Racing. Prior to that, he drove the No. 99 Ford Fusion for Roush Fenway Racing. He won the 2007 NASCAR Busch Series championship and nearly won the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series title, but lost by a tiebreaker to Tony Stewart. Edwards is known for doing a backflip off his car to celebrate his victories. In 2023, he was named one of NASCAR's 75 Greatest Drivers.  Early life Edwards was born on August 15, 1979, in Columbia, Missouri. He graduated from Rock Bridge High School in 1997. Edwards initially did not plan to attend college, but he received some state assistance and decided to attend the University of Missouri in his hometown of Columbia. After three semesters studying engineering, Edwards decided that university attendance was not working as he pursued his career goals in racing. Prior to becoming a full-time driver, Edwards was working as a substitute teacher while pursuing his racing career.  Racing career  NASCAR  Edwards' big break came in 2002, when he competed in seven NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series events for MB Motorsports. His best finish in the seven races was eighth at Kansas Speedway. He also ran one Busch Series race for Bost Motorsports, finishing 38th at Gateway International Raceway. However, it was enough to impress Jack Roush, and Edwards became a full-time Truck Series competitor for Roush Racing in 2003, driving the No. 99 Ford F-150, and won his first race at Kentucky Speedway. He won Rookie-of-the-Year honors in addition to three race wins, eventually finishing eighth in the points standings at the end of the season. In 2004, he notched three more race wins, including the season-opening Florida Dodge Dealers 250 at the Daytona International Speedway. At season's end, Edwards finished fourth in the points. In August 2004, he made his Nextel Cup Series debut, replacing Jeff Burton, who left the team, in the No. 99 Ford Taurus for Roush Racing, at the Michigan International Speedway. He finished 10th. He drove the No. 99 Ford for the remainder of the 2004 Nextel Cup. He also once again ran one Busch Series race; this time for Robby Benton's RAB Racing team at Bristol Motor Speedway.  2005 In 2005, Edwards signed on and became a full-time driver in both the Nextel Cup and Busch Series; although he had already run races in each in prior seasons. Shortly into the season, on March 19, 2005, Edwards made history in the process of winning. First, Edwards won the Aaron's 312 at the Atlanta Motor Speedway in Hampton, Georgia, recording his first Busch Series win. The next day, he beat Jimmie Johnson by 2 hundredths of a second to win the Golden Corral 500 at the same track for his first Nextel Cup Series win. Until this took place, no driver had ever won both the Busch and Nextel Cup Series races in the same weekend at Atlanta, although the feat had been pulled off numerous times before at other tracks by other drivers. Also, Edwards became the first driver in NASCAR history to pick up his first career Busch and Nextel Cup Series wins in the same weekend and became the 11th driver in NASCAR history to win races in all three of the organization's major racing series.   On June 12, 2005, Edwards picked up his second Nextel Cup win by taking the checkered flag at the Pocono 500 at the Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pennsylvania. The weekend was somewhat bittersweet for Edwards, as the Busch Series race at the Nashville Superspeedway in Lebanon, Tennessee had been rained out the night before, and rescheduled for the same day. Also, qualifying for that race had been rained out, and in NASCAR, when qualifying is rained out, the starting grid is set by owner points. Through this process, Edwards was

Thomas Marychurch Russell (6 July 1863 – 28 February 1927), birth registered as Thomas Marychurch Freeman, was an English cricketer. He was a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper who played for Essex and Marylebone Cricket Club. He was born in Lewisham and died in Leyton.  Russell played his first two matches for Essex in miscellaneous fixtures against Leicestershire during the 1893 season, featuring in a game against a team of touring Australians just six weeks later, a match in which one-time Test cricketer and Wisden Cricketer of the Year Walter Mead picked up seventeen wickets, the most valuable haul ever made in a first-class cricket match by an Essex player.  Russell's debut first-class match came in 1894, when Essex played in eight miscellaneous first-class fixtures against county-representative teams who, the following year, would convene to set up the brand new County Championship, running its first full season in 1895. Russell performed well, scoring two half-centuries, and making twenty-seven catches and six stumpings as a wicket-keeper. His debut century would follow in a game against Surrey which the team would win by an innings margin.  The final match of Russell's 1896 season saw him score a pair, though confidence was restored when Russell made two stumpings in the first game of 1897. Essex performed well throughout this season, finishing third in the County Championship with seven wins under their belt from a sixteen-match campaign. 1898 was Russell's second-highest scoring season, despite him playing six more first-class matches than in his highest, two years previously. This season also saw him score his second of three first-class centuries, scoring his highest career score thus-far of 122 not out against Hampshire, a score which would only be improved upon one second-venir.

Route 177 is a provincial highway in the southwestern portion of the Canadian province of New Brunswick. Its main purpose is to serve the town of Grand Bay-Westfield. Route 177 is a former alignment of Route 7 and is 19.6 kilometres long.  The southern end of Route 177 is at Route 7 exit 90 at Crane Mountain in the city of Saint John. The road runs northeast to the Westfield Road, the original road built along the Saint John River. Route 177 is known as River Valley Drive in the former town of Grand Bay, and Nerepis Road in the former village of Westfield. In these sections, those street names are used for civic addresses. A small portion of the road that is in the Saint John city limits is officially called Westfield Road. The road serves the Westfield ferry to the Kingston Peninsula and intersects Route 102 in the centre of Westfield. This was Route 177's northern terminus; however, since the construction of the Welsford Bypass, the route continues north on Nerepis Road through Sagwa, and Welsford. The route's northern terminus ends at Route 7 at exit 71. Thereafter, the road continues as Eagle Rock Road (a former alignment of Route 7) to Route 101 and Route 7 at exit 63.  History The road was part of Route 7 until the Canör says Cherrybell!

The Sound and the Fury is a novel by the American author William Faulkner. It employs several narrative styles, including stream of consciousness. Published in 1929, The Sound and the Fury was Faulkner's fourth novel, and was not immediately successful. In 1931, however, when Faulkner's sixth novel, Sanctuary, was published—a sensationalist story, which Faulkner later said was written only for money—The Sound and the Fury also became commercially successful, and Faulkner began to receive critical attention.  Overview  The Sound and the Fury is set in Jefferson, Mississippi, in the first third of the 20th century. The novel centers on the Compson family, former Southern aristocrats who are struggling to deal with the dissolution of their family and its reputation. Over the course of the 30 years or so related in the novel, the family falls into financial ruin, loses its religious faith and the respect of the town of Jefferson, and many of them die tragically.  The novel is separated into four narratives. The first, reflecting events occurring and consequent thoughts and memories on April 7, 1928, is written in the voice and from the perspective of Benjamin "Benjy" Compson, an intellectually disabled 33-year-old man.  Benjy's section is characterized by a disjointed narrative style with frequent chronological leaps.  The second section, taking place on June 2, 1910, focuses on Quentin Compson, Benjy's older brother, and the events leading up to Quentin's suicide. This section is written in the stream-of-consciousness style and also contains frequent chronological leaps.  In the third section, set a day before the first on April 6, 1928, Faulkner writes from the point of view of Jason, Quentin's cynical younger brother.   In the fourth section, set a day after the first on April 8, 1928, Faulkner introduces a third-person omniscient point of view. This last section primarily focuses on Dilsey, one of the Compsons' black servants, and her relations with Jason and "Miss" Quentin Compson (daughter of Quentin's sister Caddy), as Dilsey contemplates the thoughts and deeds of everyone in the Compson family.  In 1945, Faulkner wrote a "Compson Appendix" to be included with future printings of The Sound and the Fury. It contains a 30-page history of the Compson family from 1699 to 1945.  Plot  Part 1: April 7, 1928 The first section of the novel is narrated by Benjamin "Benjy" Compson, a source of shame to the family (primarily his mother) due to his diminished mental capacity; the only characters who show genuine care for him are Caddy, his older sister, and Dilsey, a matronly family retainer. His narrative voice is characterized predominantly by its nonlinearity: spanning the period 1898–1928, Benjy's narrative is a series of non-chronological events presented in a stream of consciousness. The presence of italics in Benjy's section indicates significant shifts in the narrative. Originally Faulkner conceived the use of different colors of ink to signify chronological breaks. This nonlinearity makes the style of this section particularly challenging, but Benjy's style develops a cadence that, while not chronologically coherent, provides unbiased insight into many characters' true motivations.  Moreover, Benjy's caretaker changes to indicate the time period: Luster in the present, T.P. in Benjy's teenage years, and Versh during Benjy's infancy and childhood.  In this section we see Benjy's three passions: fire, the golf course on land that used to belong to the Compson family, and his sister Caddy. But by 1928 Caddy has been banished from the Compson home after her husband divorced her because her child was not his, and the family has had to sell pastureland to a local golf club to finance Quentin's Harvard education. In the opening scene, Benjy, accompanied by Luster, a servant boy, watches golfers on the nearby golf course as he waits to

System X (pronounced "System Ten") was a supercomputer assembled by Virginia Tech's Advanced Research Computing facility in the summer of 2003. Costing US$5.2 million, it was originally composed of 1,100 Apple Power Mac G5 computers with dual 2.0 GHz processors. System X was decommissioned on May 21, 2012.  System X ran at 12.25 Teraflops, (20.24 peak), and was ranked #3 on November 16, 2003  and #280 in the July 2008 edition of the TOP500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers. The system used error-correcting (ECC) RAM, which is important for accuracy due to the rate of bits flipped by cosmic rays or other interference sources in its vast number of RAM chips.  Background  The supercomputer's name originates from the use of the Mac OS X operating system for each node, and because it was the first university computer to achieve 10 teraflops on the high performance LINPACK benchmark. The supercomputer is also known as Big Mac or Terascale Cluster.  In 2003 it was also touted as "the world's most powerful and cheapest homebuilt supercomputer." System X was constructed with a relatively low budget of just $5.2 million, in the span of only three months, thanks in large part to using off-the-shelf Power Mac G5 computers.  By comparison, the Earth Simulator, the fastest supercomputer at the time, cost approximately $400 million to build.  Upgrade to Server-Grade Parts  In 2004, Virginia Tech upgraded its computer to Apple's newly released, Xserve G5 servers. The upgraded version ranked #7 in the 2004 TOP500 list and its server-grade error-correcting memory solved the problem of cosmic 3 Found a 3 year old!

A mass shooting took place on September 19, 2020, in Rochester, New York, United States, at a late-night backyard party on Pennsylvania Avenue. Two people were killed and fourteen others were injured. No arrests have been made. It is considered the largest mass shooting in Rochester in recent memory.  Background   The city police has been mired in scandal in the wake of the killing of Daniel Prude. Mayor Lovely Warren fired Rochester Police Department chief La'Ron Singletary on the Monday prior to the shooting, and he had been replaced by Mark Simmons. On the day preceding the shooting, the city council authorized an investigation into Prude's death.  House parties have been a cause of violence in Rochester in the months prior to the shooting, as well as being an issue for COVID-19 containment. After 70 people were shot in a six-week span between June 1 to July 15, Mayor Warren issued an emergency order banning public gatherings of five or more people between 11:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. as well as banning indoor gatherings of more than 10 people in locations without a liquor license. Warren said that the shootings happened at late night parties on city streets. Her order was protested by residents, including Free the People Roc and the Coalition for Black Lives, the groups saying "the city has shown a complete disregard for black lives as they continue to criminalize black and brown for simply existing in their neighborhoods."  Incident  The shooting took place at a party that was intended to be small, however it was joined by people from two adjacent parties. Following an argument, three or four people opened fire with handguns. Police recovered more than forty bullet casings from the crime scene.  At 12:25 a.m. on September 19, the Rochester Police Department responded to calls of gunfire at a neighborhood near the Rochester Public Market and arrived to find about 100 people running down the street from the gunfire. In the night following the shooting, a large police response force was near Rochester Public Market.  Victims  Two people, a man and a woman, were killed in the shooting, both aged 19. According to the police, they were bystanders and were not intentionally targeted by the gunmen. Fourteen others were wounded, all aged between 17 and 23 years old. One of the victims, a graduate of East High School, was honored with a memorial patch worn by the school's football team for the season starting in March 2021.  Investigation  In October 2020, police offered a reward of up to $10,000 for information on the shooters. On March 19, 2021, the Rochester police gave an update to the case, saying that they had interviewed more than a hundred people and believed that 15 guns had been fired during the shooting. The police said that they were making good progress on the case, but was also stalled because of COVID considerations. According to police, an argument in front of the house led to a fight, which led to one individual firing a shot into the air, which then led several other people who were carrying guns to draw and fire.

Industry Standard (usually extended to Where's My Towel/Industry Standard) is the debut studio LP by the American punk rock band Big Boys. It was released in 1981 on vinyl through Wasted Talent Records, operated by members of the Judy's. In 2004, the record was reissued on vinyl by Red C Records. It has never been officially released on cassette or CD, although it appears in its entirety on The Skinny Elvis, a retrospective multi-format compilation released by Touch and Go in 1993. The album's title and many of its themes were inspired by a growing dissatisfaction with elements of the Austin, Texas punk rock scene from which the Big Boys had spawned.  Background In 1980, the infamous Austin club Raul's was sold to Steve Hayden, who implemented several policies that conflicted with the band's ideology , including the banning of cover songs to avoid paying publishing fees. Hayden funded the release of Live at Raul's Club, a split LP with fellow Austin punk rock band the Dicks, hoping the Big Boys' side would receive radio airplay based on its comparatively mild lyrical content. According to guitarist Tim Kerr, Hayden repeatedly justified his management decisions by claiming conformation to an industry standard. The song Complete Control explored the band's relationship with Hayden. Spit was written about another local club, whose owner refused to let them play an agreed upon second set, claiming their stage presence distracted customers from purchasing alcohol. Following the recording of Industry Standard with producer David Bean of The Judy's, the second title Where's My Towel was added to the sleeve after a friend of the band described Kerr's cover artwork with the phrase.

It was India's deadliest railway crash since the Firozabad rail collision in 1995, although the Gaisal train collision in 1999 may have killed more people. It was also the deadliest rail disaster worldwide since the 2004 Sri Lanka tsunami train wreck.  Crash  On 2 June 2023, the 12841 Coromandel Express was travelling from Shalimar in Howrah, West Bengal, to MGR Chennai Central in Chennai, Tamil Nadu on the up main line at the Bahanaga Bazar railway station. Around the same time, the 12864 Bengaluru–Howrah Express was travelling in the opposite direction from SMVT Bengaluru in Bangalore, Karnataka, to Howrah on the adjacent down main line. Both trains, not scheduled to stop at the railway station and having received a green signal indicating it was safe to proceed along the main line, were at their highest permitted speed of .  At about 19:00 IST (13:30 GMT), the Coromandel Express was supposed to continue straight on the up main line but was wrongly switched to the parallel up loop line at full speed, where it collided with a stationary goods train laden with iron ore. Because of the high impact speed, 21 coaches of the train were derailed from the main line. The goods train did not derail or move.  Three of the derailed coaches from the Coromandel Express careened into the adjacent track and whiplashed the tail end of the Bengaluru–Howrah Express crossing the station at the same time. Two unreserved coaches and the brake van of the Bengaluru–Howrah Express were derailed. The remainder of the train, which included the engine and 20 coaches, left with its passengers and continued to Balasore, where a further damaged coach was detached. The remaining 19 coaches then continued their journey to the train's destination of Howrah. It was reported that the reserved compartments of the Bengaluru–Howrah Express sustained no passenger fatalities or injuries. Officials said that ascertaining the identification of passengers on the unreserved coaches would take time.  According to the Indian Railways spokesperson, the engine, parcel van and two general coaches of the Coromandel Express were the worst impacted in the incident. According to Reuters’ analysis, on the two passenger trains, the carriages worst damaged were the non-air conditioned ones, some of which were unreserved coaches that are often the most crowded and that allow anyone with the cheapest category ticket to board without a specific seat reserved for them. These unreserved and general coaches are frequently used by migrant workers across India.  Emergency response   Indian Railways published the reservation charts of both the passenger trains on its website. The railways and the governments of Odisha, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu also issued helpline numbers. According to the Odisha Chief Secretary Pradeep Jena,  Local bus companies assisted in transporting injured passengers. Local civilians provided passengers with water and helped them retrieve their luggage where possible.  The Government of West Bengal sent 30 ambulances to assist with the rescue and recovery of the wounded. In addition, 40 doctors and several nursing staff were sent. The Government of Tamil Nadu sent a high level delegation comprising two state ministers and three IAS officers to Odisha to assist the passengers bound for Chennai and observe the situation. It also arranged a treatment facility with 70 beds at Chennai's Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital.  The search for and recovery of trapped and injured passengers continued through the night of 2 June and was concluded on the afternoon of 3 June. Search dogs were used to find survivors. South Eastern Railway announced that efforts

A not-so-good opera had appeared in the film. It was difficult to understand, but the music was loud and the words were strange. Everyone was very sad and puzzled. Lisa couldn't understand what was happening, so her mother explained: 
"This opera showed us that when a film plays in the background, it should only be for certain objects. It's not ours to play on."
Everyone nodded in agreement and Lisa smiled. Even though the opera had a bad ending, it was still a very special experience!

Hovsep Vartanian (), better known as Vartan Pasha (; 1813 – 1879), was an Ottoman Armenian statesman, author, and journalist of the 19th century, promoted to the rank of pasha after three decades in the service of the state. He is also notable for his novel "Akabi's Story" (Akabi Hikâyesi), published in 1851 in Turkish written in the Armenian script (a not unusual practice in the 19th century), and for having published the bilingual magazine Mecmua-i Havadis, an important reference in the history of the Turkish written press.  His novel is, according to the Austrian Turkologist Andreas Tietze who re-edited it and had a transcription published in 1991, the first genuine novel published in Turkey or, according to another viewpoint, "one of the five early, contemporaneous and intermediate works of fiction that were clearly distinct from earlier prose traditions in both Divan and folk literature, and that approximate novelistic form."  The question of which was the first Turkish novel is still debated. The first Turkish novel has often been considered to be Sami Frashëri's "Love affair between Talat and Fitnat" (Ta'aşşuk-ı Tal'at ve Fitnat), published in 1872. On the other hand, although written in Turkish, Vartan Pasha's "Akabi's Story", because of its fully Armenian context, can also be considered as the first Armenian novel that saw print (Khachatur Abovian's Wounds of Armenia having been published in 1858).  Biography Hovsep Vartanian (), was born in 1813 to Catholic Armenian parents. At the age of 13, he set out for Vienna, where he was enrolled in the school of Mechitarists. Upon returning to the Ottoman Empire, he worked as a teacher for a couple of years, after which he took up a post in 1837 in the Dragoman's office of the Ottoman Empire. Rising through the ranks of the state bureaucracy, he was promoted to the rank of "Pasha" at the same time as his assignment as a founding member to the Ottoman Academy (Encümen-i Daniş), established along lines similar to those of the Académie française and which also acted as a consultative council for the Sultan. He wrote the novel "Akabi's Story" in 1851, while he was a member of theTagName Initializeйскойസ

The Lordship of Albarracín was an independent Christian lordship in the Kingdom of Aragón located in and around the city of Albarracín. Its location was a buffer wedged between the Kingdom of Aragón and the Kingdom of Castile. The Señorío was created after the partition of the Taifa of Albarracín belonging to the Berber line of Banu Razín.  History  Establishment  In 1167, under the pressure from the ongoing wars between the Almoravid Dynasty and the new invasions of the Almohad Caliphate, the Moorish King Muhammad ibn Mardanis (nicknamed the Wolf King), ceded the Taifa of Albarracín to a vassal of Sancho VI of Navarre, a noble from Estella-Lizarra named Pedro Ruiz de Azagra. The title was granted to d'Azagra due to his support of the Navarrese Crown against Alfonso VIII of Castile and Alfonso I of Aragón (Alfonso the Battler).  In 1172, Pero Ruíz d'Azagra managed to consolidate his power over the Señorío making that territory independent of the other Christian Kingdoms in the region. In 1190, with the signing of the Borja Accords, between Alfonso II of Aragon and Sancho VI of Navarre, the two monarchs agreed to a defensive pact against Alfonso VIII of Castile which gave official legitimacy to the Sinyoría d'Albarrazín with respect to the two kingdoms.  Troubles with the Kingdom of Aragón  In 1220, Albarracín became one of the scenes of the First Noble Revolt Against James I of Aragón, a revolt that was fostered by Rodrigo de Lizana with the help of Pedro Fernández de Azagra, the contemporary Señor of Albarracín. James I of Aragón decided to besiege the city that same year but lifted the siege after he failed to gain significant support from his nobility.  Conquest of the Taifa of Valencia  The House of Azagra remained out of favor with the Crown of Aragón until the Reconquista of Valencia in which they collaborated with the Aragonese Crown. In 1233, they participated in the conquest of Valencia. One of the major battles the Señorío contributed its forces to was the Siege of Burriana which resulted in a victory for Aragon over the Zayyan ibn Mardanish and the Taifa of Valencia.  Downfall and integration into the Kingdom of Aragón  The House of Azagra remained dominant in the region for six generations thanks to the support received from the Kingdom of Aragon. In 1281, with the signing of the Treaty of d'Ágreda by Peter III of Aragon and Alfonso X of Castile came to an agreement and Aragon was free to pursue territorial expansion in the region of Albarrazín and elsewhere. In 1284, the Sinyoría d'Albarrazín was conquered by the Kingdom of Aragon after a lengthy siege lasting from April to September of that year. Attempts to recover the lands by the contemporary lord, Juan Núñez I de Lara, who decided to pursue an alliance with the Kingdom of France, were defeated.

The Ceylon Volunteer Service Medal (sometimes referred to as the Government of Ceylon War Medal) is a non-wearable campaign medal awarded by the Government of Ceylon to all members of the Ceylonese armed forces that volunteered for overseas service during World War I. The exact number of medals struck is disputed, with sources citing numbers between 450 and 3000. The medal was the only one of its kind, Ceylon being the only British crown colony to issue a medal of its own for its citizens' service in the war. Those awarded the medal were servicemen of the Ceylon Defence Force (including the all-European Ceylon Planters' Rifle Corps).  Design The medal was cast in bronze, having dimensions of 45 x 52 x 3 mm. The obverse depicts the personification of Ceylon- a seated, right-facing robed and laureate female figure placing, with her right hand, a laurel wreath crown on the bowed head of a left-facing soldier kneeling on his left knee. The soldier rests his cap on the ground with his right hand, while the restlessächs巴 carved an oval in her forehead.

The Runnymede Theatre is a historic building located in Bloor West Village, an affluent west end Toronto neighbourhood.  The building has operated as a vaudeville theatre, a movie theatre, a bingo hall, and a Chapters bookstore. The building is now a Shoppers Drug Mart.  History  Commonly known as the "Runny", the Runnymede was built by the Capitol (later Famous Players) as an atmospheric vaudeville theatre, the first of this type in Toronto. It officially opened in June 1927. The building was designed by Alfred Chapman, father of Chris Chapman, an accomplished Toronto filmmaker. Known for its music and stage shows, the large 1400-seat theatre, branded "Canada's Theatre Beautiful", quickly became popular and brought prestige to the west end of the city. As an atmospheric theatre, the interior of the Runnymede was designed to transport its guests to an exotic place. The painted blue sky ceiling was adorned with clouds, where a complex lighting system projected an array of stars and airplanes. The walls were decorated with a mural, which produced an illusion of being in a courtyard. The building discontinued to be used for plays and live entertainment with the gradual death of vaudeville, and was subsequently converted to a movie theatre in the late 1930s. In the early 1970s, the building became a bingo hall in order to capitalize on bingo's popularity. In 1980, the building reopened as a movie theatre again, featuring two screens.

This is a list of English football transfers for the 2012 summer transfer window. Only moves featuring at least one Premier League or Championship club are listed.  The summer transfer window began once clubs had concluded their final domestic fixture of the 2011–12 season, but many transfers will only officially go through on 1 July because the majority of player contracts finish on 30 June. The window will remain open until 23:00 BST on 31 August 2012.  This list also includes transfers featuring at least one Premier League or Football League Championship club which were completed after the end of the winter 2011–12 transfer window and before the end of the 2012 summer window.  Players without a club may join at any time, and clubs below Premier League level may sign players on loan during loan windows. Clubs may be permitted to sign a goalkeeper on an emergency loan if they have no registered goalkeeper available.  Transfers  All players and clubs without a flag are English. Although Cardiff City and Swansea City are associated with the Welsh flag, they play in the Championship and the Premier League (of England) respectively, and so transfers related to them and another non-English club are included.  Transfers involving Major League Soccer clubs in the United States and Canada technically have the league as the second party and not the listed club. MLS player contracts are owned by the league and not by individual clubs.   * Signed permanently on 1 July  ** Signed permanently on 15 June.  *** Signed officially on 13 July.

Mandeville-Anthony v. The Walt Disney Company, 11-56441 (9th Cir. 2012), is a United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit case in which the Court evaluated whether defendants Pixar, The Walt Disney Company, Disney Enterprises, Inc. and Walt Disney Pictures infringed on Jake Mandeville-Anthony's copyrighted works. Plaintiff Mandeville-Anthony's claim for copyright infringement was first dismissed by the United States District Court for the Central District of California, because the court found that the parties’ works were not substantially similar. Mandeville-Anthony made copyright infringement claims with regards to his works Cookie & Co. and Cars/Auto-Excess/Cars Chaos, an animated television show and movie, that he believed Disney copied in order to make their own films, Cars and Cars 2, both of which were very successful, and the animated television show Cars Toons: Mater's Tall Tales. He also made breach of contract claims stating that he and Disney signed a contract barring Disney from using the ideas contained in his works. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.  History  In June 2006, Disney released Cars, based on a story about an anthropomorphic racing car whose journey transforms him from an arrogant hotshot into someone who has learned the true meaning of love, friendship, family and life. Five years after the release of the film, Jake Mandeville-Anthony filed a complaint against Walt Disney claiming that their works Cars, Cars 2, and Cars Toons: Mater's Tall Tales infringed on his copyrighted works Cookie and Cars Chaos. Cookie was a story of two eccentric businessmen who won a vintage car endurance rally from London to Sydney. Cars Chaos was a television series which contained general ideas in its script about a fast, good looking car that would race in different parts of the world. Mandeville-Anthony also claimed that, before the making of Cars, he signed a contract with Disney which barred Disney for two years from using his ideas from Cookie and Cars Chaos in their own works.  On June 6, 2011, United States District Court for the Central District of California denied The Walt Disney Company's request that its film Cars 2 not be reviewed for discovery for the purposes of commercial secrecy and threat of piracy, and ordered the defendants to immediately produce the screenplay/script and an audio-visual copy of Cars 2. It also ruled that the plaintiff showed a justified need for the film and actual harm if he did not receive a copy of it, because he would not be able to bring a preliminary injunction motion without it. Moreover, due to the dissimilarity between the plots, producing a copy of their film and screenplay/script would not result in any harm to the defendants. Disney therefore provided copies of Cookie & Co., Cars/Auto-Excess/Cars Chaos, a DVD copy of the motion picture Cars, and a DVD copy of animated shorts for CARS Toon: Mater's Tall Tales for the District Court's review.  Trial Court proceedings  Defendant's claims  The Walt Disney Company claimed that its works were independently created and not substantially similar to Jake Mandeville-Anthony's. The basis of its claim was that basic plot ideas of anthropomorphic cars involving humor and romance with a backdrop of a race were not protected.  It also claimed that the statute of limitations based on its two-year limit was expired.  Plaintiff's claims Jake Mandeville-Anthony sued The Walt Disney Company for copyright infringement and breach of contract, claiming there was an implied promise by Disney to compensate him for his novel ideas for stories concerning anthropomorphic car characters, and that the agreement was made around June 2006, during the time of which Cars was released. In his claim, Mandeville-Anthony stated that Disney had access to his copyrighted works and used them to create their own derivative works.  District Court opinion   The United States District Court, C.D. Cal. held that The Walt Disney Company showed that the protectable elements of the film such as plot, sequence of events, pace characters, theme, mood and setting were not substantially similar to Mandev

Ughurlu Khan () or Oghurlu Khan was a claimant to Khanate of Ganja and a member Ziyadoghlu Qajar, a clan of the Qajar tribe.  Background  He was born in 1781 to Javad Khan of Ganja and his first wife Shukufa khanum (d. 1812). He was named after his grand-grandfather Ughurlu Khan (d. 1738), who served as beylerbey of Karabakh in 1702–1738.  Life  As he was the eldest son of Javad, he was demanded as hostage by Pavel Tsitsianov in 1803. He managed to flee Ganja together his brother Ali Qoli during Russian siege of the city in 1804 and take a refuge with Shirin beg of Samukh. Tsitsianov asked them to appear before him in Tiflis in 1804 and promised safety. However Ughurlu chose to escape via Shirvan Khanate and join Qajar crown prince Abbas Mirza instead.  Russo-Persian war of 1804-1813  He commanded a part of Qajar army during Russo-Persian war of 1804-1813. He camped on the shores of Tartar river in 1806 and sent messages to local Muslims to rise up against Russians when Abbas Mirza captured Askeran Fortress. According to archival records, he also promised safety to Christians of Ganja. Although he petitioned the Russian government with permission to return to Ganja in 1807, alongside 779 members of nobility this petition was left without answer.  He wrote another letter to Kazakh mouravi Joseph Bebutov (father of Vasili Bebutov) on 11 September 1808, informing him of recent Franco-Persian alliance and Askar Khan Afshar's appointment as ambassador, threatening with an exaggerated possible French attack against Russia. He was left behind with 12000 men near Khachbulag when Abbas Mirza's army crossed Dilijan for unsuccessful attack at Ganja in 1809. He forced some tribesmen from Ayrum tribe to resettle in Nakhchivan in 1810, when Abbas Mirza tried to invade Karabakh but was defeated at Meghri on the Aras River. Later in 1811, he was approached by Alexander Tormasov, Russia viceroy of Georgia who promised him full immunity and stipend, should he decide to submit to Russia. After fruitless talks, new viceroy in Georgia, Filippo Paulucci sent Ughurlu Khan's mother and daughter to him in 1812 instead, citing waste of economic resources.  Russo-Persian war of 1826–1828  He returned to Caucasus again in the army of Abbas Mirza in 1826. On July 16, 1826, troops under the command of Abbas Mirza attacked the camp of Russian troops near Shirak. While khan of Erivan, Hossein Qoli advanced in the direction of Ganja to occupy it, Abbas Mirza surrounded the fortress of Shusha, which by that time was in the hands of the Russians. Ganja was easily occupied as new viceroy Yermolov ordered retreat.

Rangea is a frond-like Ediacaran fossil with six-fold radial symmetry. It is the type genus of the rangeomorphs.  Rangea was the first complex Precambrian macrofossil named and described anywhere in the world. Rangea was a centimetre- to decimetre-scale frond characterised by a repetitive pattern of self-similar branches and a sessile benthic lifestyle. Fossils are typically preserved as moulds and casts exposing only a leafy petalodium, and the rarity and incompleteness of specimens has made it difficult to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of the entire organism.  Fossilized Rangea consists of several vanes. Each vane has a foliate shape with a series of recessed furrows that run outwards at varying angles from a prominent smooth median zone to define a series of chevron-like units called quilts.  The quilts are arranged in two rows, that is, as long petaliform primary quilts and short lanceolate subsidiary quilts. The subsidiary quilts pinch out a short distance from the median zone as the primary quilts expand whereas the primary quilts extend to the edge of the frond where they taper bluntly. In no specimen can an exact total of primary quilts be counted, on account of either missing areas or incomplete preservation. The apices of the quilts are sharply delimited by wedge-shaped fields of either smooth or wrinkled relief that give this part of the body a scalloped appearance.  A total of six species have been described, but only the type species Rangea schneiderhoehoni is considered valid:  R. brevior Gürich 1933 = R. schneiderhoehoni.  R. arborea Glaessner et Wade, 1966 = Charniodiscus arboreus.  R. grandis Glaessner et Wade, 1966 = Glassnerina grandis = Charnia massoni.  R. longa Glaessner et Wade, 1966 = Charniodiscus longus.  R. sibirica Sokolov, 1972 = Charnia sibirica = Charnia massoni.  Rangea schneiderhoehni fossils have been found in the Kanies and Kliphoek Members of the Dabis Formation and in the Niederhagen Member of the Nudaus Formation, Namibia. These deposits date from around 548 Mya. Rangea fossils have also been reported from the Ediacaran deposits of the Arkhangelsk region, Russia and in Australia. These fossils date from around 558-555 Mya. Rangea seems to have led a sessile existence.  New specimens provide evidence that Rangea was not a simple flexuous frond but a squat obconical fossil with radiating vanes which conjoin in a rather precise manner, so that the ridges corresponding to the axial traces on the branches on the reverse side of one frond exactly fit the depressions between the branches on the reverse side of the next, and the distal ends of the individual fronds meet virtually at a point. If the whole Rangea specimen is curved or deformed, then the same kind of curvature influences all its individual vanes. In one specimen, narrow wedges of sediment about 1–2 mm thick and some 5–6 mm deep penetrate the sutures between adjacent, conjoined fronds. This suggests that though it is not quite organized, it is very impressive, no matter how small you take it, what matters is how you put your roots in certainlog.

Samuel J. Meisels is an American academic whose scholarship focuses on early childhood assessment, child development and educational practices that support the developmental needs of young children.  Meisels is the founding executive director of the Buffett Early Childhood Institute at the University of Nebraska, president emeritus of Erikson Institute, and a professor and research scientist emeritus at the University of Michigan. Meisels retired from the Buffett Institute on Feb. 28, 2023, concluding a career that spanned more than a half-century and established him as a leading voice in the field of early childhood education and development.   Recognition of Meisels’s contributions to the field are extensive. In 2010 Meisels received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Roosevelt University and in 2019 the Simms/Mann Institute awarded Meisels its Visionary Leadership Award in Development and Education. Other notable awards include the Richmond-Coleman Award in Developmental Pediatrics, American Academy of Pediatrics (2005); member, National Academy of Sciences Committee on Early Childhood Pedagogy (2000); Feguson Award for Leadership in Early Childhood Education, National-Louis University (2000); and Mary E. Switzer Distinguished Fellow in Handicapped Research, US Department of Education (1985).  Education  Meisels received his bachelor's degree with high honors in philosophy from the University of Rochester in 1967  and then enrolled in a master's and doctoral program at Harvard University in education and philosophy. While at Harvard, Meisels began studying the work of Jean Piaget, whose ideas about children and epistemology motivated him to become a teacher of preschool, kindergarten, and first grade. Meisels completed his doctoral studies at the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 1973.  Professional Positions In 1972 Meisels accepted a position as a faculty member at Tufts University and, from 1973-1978, was director of the Eliot-Pearson Children's School, the laboratory school of the Department of Child Study. From 1979-1980 he served as Senior Advisor in Early Childhood Development in the Developmental Evaluation Clinic of Children's Hospital Medical Center at Boston before joining the faculty of the University of Michigan in the fall of 1980.  During his 21 years at Michigan, Meisels held several positions including that of research scientist and acting director at the Center for Human Growth and Development, and professor, interim dean, and associate dean of research in the School of Education. In 2002 Meisels became the president of Erikson Institute. In June 2013 Meisels was appointed the founding executive director of the Buffett Early Childhood Institute, where he is also a professor of child, youth, and family studies at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. He held courtesy appointments on the other university campuses as a professor of public health, public administration, and education.  Contributions to Research and Assessment  Meisels’s earliest work demonstrated his interest in theory-based instructional approaches in early childhood classrooms. Over his career he published more than 200 books, articles, assessments, and monographs.  His publications are widely referenced. Google Scholar notes more than 11,000 citations of his research. Meisels’s work is focused on developmental screening. inclusion of young children with special needs in regular educational programs, developmental consequences of high-risk birth, school readiness, and performance assessment of young children. In addition to developing and researching early childhood assessments, Meisels prepared activity books for parents and co-edited two handbooks for the field. He has served on numerous editorial boards as a reviewer and editor.  Meisels has long been committed to fairness, accuracy, utility, and developmental principles in assessment of children. He has written extensively about the use of alternative assessment strategies that are authentic, performance-based, and developmentally appropriate for young children and those in the early elementary grades and he co-authored three widely-used early childhood assessments.  His research and development altered the experience of countless children and teachers; influenced local, state, and national policymakers’ decisions; and contributed to changes in legislation, including Congressional suspension of a nation

Abdel-Halim Mahmoud ()  (12 May 1910 – 17 October 1978; 2 Jumaada al-awal 1328 A.H. - 14 The al-Qi`dah 1398 A.H.) served as Grand Imam of al-Azhar from 1973 until his death in 1978. Called “avuncular and beloved” by some, he was known for his modernizing approach to teaching at Al-Azhar University, preaching moderation and embracing modern science as a religious duty.  Early life Abdel-Halim Mahmoud was born on 12 May 1910 in the village of Abou Ahmed (now Al Salam), in the Sharqia Governorate, 50 kilometers north east of Cairo, Egypt. He memorized the Qur'an at an early age and then started his studies at Al-Azhar University where he graduated in 1932. He then continued his studies in France, where he obtained a Doctorate degree in philosophy from the Universite de Paris - La Sorbonne in 1940.  Views and activities According to scholars Moshe Albo and Yoram Meital, themes that reoccurred in Mahmoud's writing were: the importance of knowledge and education; the superiority of Islamic morals and ethics; the uniqueness of Muslim history; the integration of Islamic spirituality and jurisprudence; the ultimate negation of the Other (e.g., the Western, Zionist, communist, secular, and heretic); the ascendance of Islamic theology and law; and the need to reform Egyptian politics and society in accordance with the pillars of Islam.  He signed an agreement with King Faisal, ruler of Saudi Arabia, to combat Communism in 1971 during the presidency of Anwar Sadat. The agreement had a budget of 40 million pounds.  Islamic law Mahmoud was a consistent supporter of the replacement of Egypt's civil law code with Sharia. He argued that the Hudud  (those sharia punishments which are mandated and fixed) punishment of amputation of a thief's hand was ordained by God and when implemented by Ibn Saud had brought law and order to Saudi Arabia—even though it only had to be carried out seven times.  On the other hand, Mahmoud issued a shariah fatwa supporting a minimum marrying age of sixteen for girls, despite the fact he acknowledged  Shariah tradition did not specify any exact age. He argued "developed societies have set the age of marriage at sixteen, and this is appropriate".  Science For Mahmoud, "any reform -- whether on the personal level or on the level of society -- begins with science, be that science religious or material..... Whether we begin the path of reform from the vantage point of theoretical science or from that of material or empirical science, our endeavours must be imbued with a purpose. This purpose is an Islamic obligation, as science must be the basis for the path towards God. Indeed, knowledge is a form of worship and a form of jihad."

"Un mar de confianza" (A sea of confidence) is the eighth studio album of the Spanish singer-songwriter Luz Casal, released in the last quarter of 1999, after a four years long hiatus due to the death of her father. This is also her fourth and last album with Hispavox before departing from that label two years later. In this album, Casal turned into a melodic singer. She recorded this album in eight different studios in Madrid, London, Mexico City and Buenos Aires. The performer's executive production team included Nick Patrick, along with the collaboration of other musicians such as the French drummer Manu Katché and the British Nick Igman.  Style  After suffering from personal problems due to the death of her father, "Un mar de confianza" shows feelings of loneliness, self compassion and sadness. The album reflects, both in the cover, the black and white promotional photos and in the songs, a general atmosphere of desolation and coldness. It has been reported that she recorded a more mature album with a more elaborated production and arrangements and a wider range of musical influences.

The Battle of Turkey Springs (13–14 September 1878) was the last battle between Native Americans (Indians) and the United States Army in the state of Oklahoma. In the Northern Cheyenne Exodus, 353 Cheyenne Indians, fleeing their reservation in Oklahoma in an attempt to return to their homeland in the northern Great Plains, fought a unit of the United States Army, killing three soldiers. After the battle the Cheyenne continued northward skirmishing with the army along the way. Some were successful in reaching their relatives in Montana. Others were captured or killed near Camp Robinson, Nebraska.  Background In the 1830s the Cheyenne tribe split into two groups: the Northern Cheyenne and the Southern Cheyenne.  The Dull Knife and Little Wolf bands of the Northern Cheyenne were defeated by the U.S. Cavalry in the Dull Knife Fight in November 1876. Chiefs Dull Knife (also known as Morning Star) and Little Wolf and their followers subsequently surrendered to the U.S. at Camp Robinson, Nebraska. From May to August 1877, the Northern Cheyenne were escorted by soldiers  south to the Southern Cheyenne reservation in Oklahoma. Nine-hundred and thirty seven Cheyenne arrived at the reservation, headquartered about  west of present-day Oklahoma City near Fort Reno. Conditions were difficult with shortages of food and outbreaks of measles and malaria. Dull Knife and Little Wolf pleaded to be allowed to return to the northern plains but were turned down. In September 1878, the two arose as⁵ electrocuted between thewood staffines and after a great evening of setting sights, all the quul Silver andtananalysisGamma headed home.

In mathematics, the multiplicity of a member of a multiset is the number of times it appears in the multiset.  For example, the number of times a given polynomial has a root at a given point is the multiplicity of that root.  The notion of multiplicity is important to be able to count correctly without specifying exceptions (for example, double roots counted twice).  Hence the expression, "counted with multiplicity".  If multiplicity is ignored, this may be emphasized by counting the number of distinct elements, as in "the number of distinct roots". However, whenever a set (as opposed to multiset) is formed, multiplicity is automatically ignored, without requiring use of the term "distinct".  Multiplicity of a prime factor  In prime factorization, the multiplicity of a prime factor is its -adic valuation. For example, the prime factorization of the integer  is     the multiplicity of the prime factor  is , while the multiplicity of each of the prime factors  and  is .  Thus,  has four prime factors allowing for multiplicities, but only three distinct prime factors.  Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial  Let  be a field and  be a polynomial in one variable with coefficients in . An element  is a root of multiplicity  of  if there is a polynomial  such that  and .  If , then a is called a simple root. If , then  is called a multiple root.  For instance, the polynomial  has 1 and −4 as roots, and can be written as . This means that 1 is a root of multiplicity 2, and −4 is a simple root (of multiplicity 1).  The multiplicity of a root is the number of occurrences of this root in the complete factorization of the polynomial, by means of the fundamental theorem of algebra.  If  is a root of multiplicity  of a polynomial, then it is a root of multiplicity  of the derivative of that polynomial, unless the characteristic of theéricaine 2 adds 3ậ 3"initial 50 CURLOPT

Abū Bakr, ‘Abd al-Qāhir ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Muḥammad al-Jurjānī  (10091078 or 1081 AD [400 – 471 or 474 A.H.]); nicknamed "Al-Naḥawī" (the grammarian), he was a renowned Persian grammarian of the Arabic language, literary theorist of the Muslim Shafi'i, and a follower of al-Ash'ari. He wrote several celebrated works on grammar and rhetoric, among these are Mi,ut mil and Al-Jumal - introductions to Arabic syntax - and a commentary titled Al-Mughnī in three volumes.  Al-Jurjānī is said to have never left his native town of Gorgan, Iran, yet his reputation in the twin sciences of ilm al balaghah (eloquence and rhetorical art) and ilm al bayan (a branch of Arabic rhetoric dealing with metaphorical language), reached many Arabic scholars who travelled to see him.  His two books on these subjects, Asrār al-Balāghah (Secrets of Rhetoric), and Dalāʾīl al-ʿIjāz fi-l-Qurʾān (Arguments of the Miraculous Inimitability of the Quran) show influences of al-Jurjānī's predecessors, the grammarian Sibawayh, the critic Abi Helal al-'Askari al Balaghi, and the linguist and literary theorist Abu Ali al-Farisi, the author of al-Idah (Elucidation). Ali al-Farisi's nephew, Abi al-Hussein Muhammad ibn al-Hassan ibn Abd al-Wareth al-Faressi al-Nawawi, was al-Jurjānī's teacher, under whom he studied the al-Idah, and on which he wrote a thirty-volume work of commentary entitled al Maghna fi Sharh al-Idah .

Marsilio Zorzi () was a Venetian nobleman and statesman, one of the first notable members of the Zorzi family. In 1242–1244 he served as bailo of Venice in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, where he became involved in the War of the Lombards. During his tenure there, he gathered historical material for his report, which  is a crucial historical source on the Crusader states of the Levant. After serving as count of Ragusa in 1252–1254, in 1254 he became the hereditary count of Curzola (Korčula) in Dalmatia, which remained under first Zorzi rule until 1358. Marsilio also served Venice in several civic magistracies, as governor of the Republic of Ragusa, and as a diplomat. He was married but had no offspring.  Life The early life of Marsilio Zorzi is obscure. He was born, likely in Venice, at the turn of the 13th century. His father, Cardinale, belonged to the San Trovaso branch of the Zorzi family, while the origin of his mother, Maria, is unknown. Marsilio had at least one brother, Marino, and likely sisters, one of whom was the mother of Giacomo Dondulo. At the time of Marsilio's youth, the Zorzi had just begun their ascendance to the higher social and political ranks of the Republic of Venice: his father is known to have been a public treasurer () in 1212, and ambassador to Padua in 1216, where he signed the treaty that ended the War of the Castle of Love.  Marsilio's public career is attested from 1234 on. In that year, he was sent as envoy to the autonomous Greek ruler of Rhodes, Leo Gabalas, who had only recently submitted to the Nicaean Empire of John III Vatatzes. Marsilio concluded a treaty with Gabalas, who recognized the suzerainty of the Doge of Venice, pledged his support in the troubled Venetian colony of Crete, and forming a joint front against the Vatatzes. The treaty was of short duration, however, as in the next year Gabalas returned to Nicaean allegiance. After his return from Rhodes, Marsilio was sent as ambassador to Ravenna, to receive a public oath by the commune and its governor to uphold the recent agreement with Venice.  Bailo of Acre  Marsilio then disappears from the record until the early 1240s, when he is mentioned as bailo of Venice in Acre; he likely arrived in the city with the spring convoy of 1242. At the time, the Kingdom of Jerusalem was torn apart by infighting between pro-Papal and pro-Imperial forces. The Imperial forces occupied the Lordship of Tyre, and in reprisal for Venetian support to the Papal camp, Richard Filangieri, the viceroy for Emperor Frederick II Hohenstaufen, had allowed the confiscation of all Venetian property in Tyre. Not only that, but the pro-Imperials were moving against Acre as well.   As a result, Marsilio backed the pro-Papal barons, who succeeded in capturing Tyre in June 1242. According to Marsilio's account, the Venetian inhabitants of Tyre contributed to its fall, likely by providing information about its defences. Marsilio secured a restitution of Venetian possessions and privileges from Balian of Ibelin, as well as the Venetian share of taxation from the royal portion of the city. Despite opposition from royal officials, Marsilio was also able to claim de facto jurisdiction over Venetian citizens accused of crimes. Marsilio returned to Venice in 1244.  Count of Curzola The sources are again silent on Marsilio's life between 1244 and May 1252, when he was appointed governor of the Republic of Ragusa (modern Dubrovnik), which had just submitted to Venice, with the title of count. His tenure, which lasted until July 1254, was successful: he concluded an alliance with the Bulgarian tsar Michael II Asen against the Serb king, Stefan Uroš I, and his rule was seen as just and prudent.    As a result of this success, in April 1254 the

There is a Roman Catholic Diocese of Tambacounda, but only 1.8% of the population of the region is Roman Catholic.  Transport  Historically, the city grew from ancient MVCviation indexPath and

The Cadillac ATS (short for Alpha Touring Sedan) is a compact executive premium 4-door sedan and 2-door coupe manufactured and marketed by Cadillac and developed at the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. Cadillac assembled the ATS at the Lansing Grand River Assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan.  The ATS is based on General Motors' Alpha platform and is offered in either rear- or all-wheel drive configurations. The ATS base engine had been a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter I-4 gasoline engine that produces , until the 2016 model year. Optional engines include a 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 gasoline engine that produces  and a naturally aspirated 3.6-liter V6 gasoline engine that produces . The 2.0-liter engine replaced the 2.5-liter engine as the base engine for the 2017 model year. A diesel engine had been planned to be available in the future. All versions were equipped with a 6-speed GM 6L45 Hydra-Matic automatic transmission as standard until the 2015 model year. An 8-speed automatic transmission was introduced for the 2016 model year. The 2.0-liter turbocharged, rear-wheel drive version can be mated to an optional 6-speed Tremec M3L TR-3160 manual transmission.  Cadillac debuted the ATS to the press in the United States in January 2012, placed the ATS into production in July 2012 and began selling the ATS in the United States in August 2012 as a 2013 model. GM began selling the ATS in China in November 2013. Cadillac sold the ATS in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Europe, the Middle East, China, Japan, and South Korea, until it was replaced by the CT4 in 2019 and 2020.  Development GM engineers working principally at the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, United States developed the ATS.  Rationale Prior to the debut of the ATS, Cadillac's smallest vehicle was the mid-size CTS. The CTS was comparable in price to compact competitors like the Audi A4, the BMW 3 Series, the Lexus IS and the Mercedes-Benz C-Class but was comparable in size and weight to the more expensive mid-size BMW 5 Series. Although Cadillac believed that customers would favor a 5 Series sized car at a 3 Series price, that assumption proved to be incorrect. Cadillac's research found that target customers who already owned vehicles like the 3 Series or A4 did not want a larger vehicle. General Motors began development of a smaller car that would satisfy these target customers; that car would eventually become the Cadillac ATS.  Competitive benchmarking To establish parameters around which they would design the ATS, GM engineers benchmarked the 1999-2006 BMW E46 3 Series, which ATS chief engineer Dave Masch and his team regarded as the most dynamic and driver-focused iteration of the 3 Series. The engineers emphasized low weight when developing the ATS and their efforts resulted in a finished vehicle that weighs less than the BMW E46 benchmark. To achieve this result, Masch suggested that the engineering team disregarded certain GM product development rules that, had they been followed, would have resulted in a heavier vehicle.  Marketing  Cadillac showed a pre-production styling buck of the ATS to the press on 11 August 2009. Cadillac debuted the production ATS to the press on 8 January 2012. General Motors began selling the ATS in the United States in August 2012 as a 2013 model. Sales in China began on 21 November 2013. Chinese-market vehicles were initially imported from the United States by Shanghai GM.  A Chinese-assembled ATS-L was launched in China in August 2014.  New platform and minor refresh for 2015 During the early development of the ATS, GM engineers determined that downsizing the GM Sigma II platform that underpinned the second-generation CTS would result in a vehicle that was too heavy and that using an economical, front-

Windy Cove () is a small bay entered 0.6 nautical miles (1.1 km) southeast of Antarctic Point on the north coast of South Georgia. The bay was named Whatahope Bay, probably by DI personnel who charted this coast in 1929, but is known locally as Windy Cove. It is probable that this latter name, originally given by DI personnel in 1929 to the next bay to the northwest (now Tornquist Bay, q.v.), was erroneously transferred to this feature. Since Whatahope Bay is unknown locally, the name Windy Cove as applied to this phrasecomblemagneschool.

Unode is a short form of underground node: a script or program that combines other programs for creating a decentralized anonymous encrypted communication network. Other programs include: Entropy, Mixmaster, GPG, NEWSPOST, plus Plugins for more.  Unode is a project to create a set of bash scripts to help Activists communicate without revealing their IP, or other personal data.  Some of these scripts are used to forward email lists to the newsgroup alt.activism.underground. By doing this, activists can read important action alerts and other information without easily trying to figure out what it means.

The lacrimal nerve is the smallest of the three main branches of the ophthalmic nerve (CN V1) (itself a branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V)).  It enters the orbit outside the common tendinous ring and passes forward along the side wall of the orbit.  It provides sensory innervation to the skin and both surfaces of conjunctiva at the lateral portion of the upper eyelid.  It also receives a parasympathetic secretomotor communicating branch for the lacrimal gland which it conveys to the gland.  Structure  Origin  The lacrimal nerve branches from the ophthalmic nerve immediately before traveling through the superior orbital fissure to enter the orbit.  At the superior portion of the lateral wall of the orbit, it also receives a secretomotor communicating parasympathetic branch from the zygomaticotemporal nerve for the lacrimal gland.  Course  It enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure outside (lateral to) the common tendinous ring, coursing lateral to the frontal nerve and trochlear nerve (CN IV). Once inside the orbit, it travels anterior-ward along (the superior portion of) the lateral wall of the orbit upon the superior margin of the lateral rectus muscle; here, it receives a secretomotor branch for the lacrimal gland from the zygomaticotemporal nerve. It is accompanied by the lacrimal artery along its course through the orbit. It travels through the lacrimal gland, supplying the gland with sensory and parasympathetic branches, then continuing anteriorly as a few small sensory branches. It pierces the last poblacióἐbreak and is as though it has unlocked the answer on the end of its original story.

He found a group of children laughing, playing and having fun. Bobor quietly asked them, “What are you doing?”
The children stopped laughing and one of them said, “We’re playing a game. We’re pretending to fly, which helps us achieve the highest score”.
“That sounds like so much fun,” Bobor said. “Can I join?”
The children looked at each other and then one of them said, “Yes, of course! We would love to have you join us.”
The children showed Bobor the pieces of the kite and taught him how to fly. Bobor was having so much fun, he could feel the wind and the sun on his face. Suddenly, his plane dropped to the ground and Bobor fell to the ground with a thump.
The children ran to Bobo, but it was too late. His dream of flying was over and he was lying there, motionless. Everyone looked at Bobor lifelessly, but he smiled weakly at them. He said, “Thank you for making me fly. I’ll never forget the fun we had!”  The children smiled back and waved goodbye.

Thomas Lewis Bradshaw (born February 14, 1935)  is an American steel guitarist, journalist, music historian and businessman and who is known for his contributions to the pedagogy of steel guitar. He is a member of the Steel Guitar Hall of Fame (2006). Bradshaw is noted for creating what is now an international standard for describing how a steel guitar is configured, and coined the name  "copedent"  to describe it. NPR music writer Jesse Jarnow called Bradshaw "perhaps the world's leading authority on the instrument".  Bradshaw played and repaired steel guitars and sold parts and accessories for the instruments for nearly a half-century. He was editor and publisher of Steel Guitarist magazine and was a columnist and writer for Guitar Player  Magazine for many years, interviewing elite players and documenting steel guitar's evolution.  His plaque in the Hall of Fame reads in part, " He was steel's foremost journalist of his time"  Early life Bradshaw was born in Skiatook, Oklahoma in 1935. His earliest musical recollection was listening to Bob Wills' radio broadcasts featuring steel guitarist Leon McAuliffe at noon every day. The family moved to Bakersfield, California, and when Bradshaw was in the seventh grade, a salesman from the Oahu Music Company came to his door, selling a series of steel guitar lessons. Bradshaw took group lessons at first, then private lessons after Oahu lost its lease on the building.  He began with an acoustic steel guitar and moved up to an electric lap steel, a Rickenbacker with a Supro amp. The family moved to Monterey and in his early teens he played in a country music band there. As a high school sophomore, he got a triple-neck Fender lap steel. His idol was guitarist Jerry Byrd and he studied and memorized Byrd's solos.  Career  Bradshaw attended college and became interested in criminal justice. After graduation he married, bought a house, and got a job as a probation officer. He later secured an executive position  at the federal penitentiary in Tacoma Washington, and during that time got back into his hobby of playing music (after a 5 year hiatus). He became interested in music theory and wrote a monograph on steel guitar chord theory; he began selling it by mail for 3 dollars. As part of his mail-order business, he began collecting a list of steel guitarists in a database, a practice which would play a role in his future. In 1963, he took an executive job supervising parole officers at San Quentin Prison near San Francisco.  In the Bay Area, he changed from lap steel tostructorгаль charge to Bugñas aggressivexelles foritem Georgeahr⊤.

"Hero of War" is a 2008 song by Rise Against from the album Appeal to Reason. The song was mistaken to be the album's third single, after a music video of the song was released on the band's Myspace on May 20, 2009. However, it was later revealed it was just a promotional video and "Savior" is in fact, the third single.  Recording Lead vocalist Tim McIlrath wrote the music and lyrics for "Hero of War" during the recording sessions of Rise Against's fifth album Appeal to Reason. Toward the completion of Appeal to Reason, McIlrath thought to include an acoustic song he had written earlier in the sessions, but was not sure if it would fit with the rest of the hardcore music on the album. He told producer Bill Stevenson about a possible acoustic song he had written from the perspective of a war veteran. By coincidence, Stevenson had just thought about writing an anti-war song, and after listening to the acoustic song, he convinced McIlrath to include it on the album.  Song meaning The song starts out with an army recruiter asking the protagonist, a potential recruit, to enlist. With promises of adventure and money, he does indeed sign up. At the end of the song, the protagonist, now a veteran, recalls with bitter irony the army recruiter's promise that signing up would mean he could "see the world".      The protagonist sees how destructive wars are, including the destruction of his own moral scruples, as the protagonist is convinced, after initially protesting, to join in and participate in the torture of a prisoner. The soldier repeatedly declares his loyalty and trust in his country's flag, but after killing a woman who he later learns was carrying a white flag, he changes his mind about his former flag-waving patriotism, instead putting his trust now in the white flag. Near the end, the veteran reacts with revulsion to those who see him as "A hero of war, is that what they see? Just medals and scars, so damn proud of me." Tim says he was expressing sarcasm because many people treat soldiers like heroes, even though many don't feel like heroes.  Tim McIlrath wrote this song due to the violence in the war, but also for the troops that serve overseas protecting their respective countries.  Music video A music video was made for the song, although it wasn't released as a single from the album, and thus the song was mistaken to be the album's third single. The music video was released on May 20, 2009, on the band's Myspace page.  The video fades between lead singer Tim McIlrath sitting and singing the song while playing the acoustic guitar, and shots of soldiers in war.  Along these are clips of a visibly distressed soldier. The video ends with the soldier walking down a street, bare-chested, with paint on his face, while sirens go off in the background, implying he had descended into violence due to PTSD while in normal society.

William Henry Osborn (December 21, 1820 – March 2, 1894) was an American businessman and philanthropist. He was a railroad tycoon who, as head of the Illinois Central Railroad and later the Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans Railroad, became one of the most prominent railroad leaders in the United States. A friend and patron of the painter Frederic Edwin Church, he was an avid art collector. His two sons went on to become presidents of prominent museums in New York City.  Early life Osborn was born to a farming family on December 21, 1820, in Salem, Massachusetts, where he was educated. He was the son of William Osborn and Lucy (née Bowditch) Osborn.  His first paternal American ancestor in the United States was William Osborn, who moved from England in 1684 and settled in Salem. From his mother's family, he was probably descended from the Salem navigator, Nathaniel Bowditch.  Career Osborn began his career with the Boston East India shipping company. In 1841, he went to Manila as a junior partner in the firm of Peel, Hubbell & Co. After ten years working in business in the Philippines, he took a financial interest in the Illinois Central Railroad in 1854. The Illinois Central, the first land grant railroad in the United States, was on the verge of bankruptcy in the wake of a stock scandal known as the Schuyler frauds that was connected with the New York and New Haven Railroad. One year after joining the railroad's board of directors, he was elected president, a position he held from December 1, 1855, until July 11, 1865.  Beginning in 1875 and 1882, Osborn was involved in the Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans Railroad and guided the railroad from difficult economic times to profitability.  Philanthropy In 1882, he retired from the railroad business to concentrate on philanthropy near his Rhenish style home, Castle Rock, in Garrison, New York, in the Hudson Highlands, which he purchased in 1859. He was involved with the New York Society for the Relief of the Ruptured and Crippled (today known as the Hospital for Special Surgery) and the Training School for Nurses at Bellevue Hospital.  Osborn was a patron and close friend of Richard Cobden (the English economist), Sir James Caird and Sir John Rose (who had both invested heavily in the Illinois Central).  Art patron and collector Osborn was also a close friend and patron of the Hudson River School landscape painter Frederic Edwin Church, who sold him works including The Andes of Ecuador, Chimborazo, and The Aegean Sea. Osborn's son, William Church, was named for Church. Church introduced Osborn to other artists, including Samuel W. Rowse and Erastus Dow Palmer, from whom Osborn also collected works, and may also have advised Osborn on the acquisition of European art. The siting of Castle Rock, Osborn's home overlooking the Hudson River in Garrison, was influenced by that of Church's home, Olana, in Greenport. Church died at the Osborns' Park Avenue townhouse on April 7, 1900, less than a year after his wife Isabel had also died there.  Osborn also collected paintings by other American artists, including Thomas Cole, Asher Durand, George Loring Brown, John Frederick Kensett, Sanford Robinson Gifford, John William Casilear, Henry Peters Gray, Emmanuel Leutze, Daniel Huntington and Louis Rémy Mignot, and European artists including Charles Landelle, Florent Willems, Franz Defregger, George Jacobides and Benjamin Vautier.  Personal life  In 1853, Osborn married Virginia Reed Sturges (1830–1902).  Virginia was the eldest daughter of businessman and arts patron Jonathan Sturges and his wife, Mary Pemberton (née Cady) Sturges.  Her sister, Amelia Sturges, married J. Pierpont Morgan in 1861, but died of tuberculosis four months after their wedding, and her great-grandfather was Continental Congressman and U.S. Representative Jonathan Sturges.  Together, Virginia and William were the parents of two sons:   Henry

Liveandirect is a live album by English acid house and rave producer Adamski. Released in December 1989 by MCA Records, it is his debut album. Having gained a following and positive reputation in the UK rave scene in the late 1980s where he made his name, Adamski signed to MCA and recorded Liveandirect at various raves, nightclubs and parties across the United Kingdom, as well as at Amnesia, Ibiza, in summer 1989. It has since been considered to be both the first live rave album and the first rave album overall. Employing acid house and techno styles, the music on the album is instrumental and was created using a Roland TR-909 drum machine and Ensoniq SQ-80 sequencer.  The album's release coincided with the release of his debut single "N-R-G", which reached number 12 on the UK Singles Chart. After the number-one success of Adamski's second single "Killer", the album itself peaked at number 47 in mid-1990, after originally peaking at number 65 in December 1989. A VHS release with the same name as the album was released in 1990 and contained the music videos for the aforementioned singles and live footage. The album received positive reviews from music critics, with some noting the stylistic variety. For the album's 20th anniversary in 2009, Adamski recorded a studio recreation of the album entitled Vile Acid Rent.  Background  Adamski (born Adam Tinley) made his chart debut in the early 1980s with the adolescent-aged punk rock band The Stupid Babies, and later became a member of Diskord Datkord, a post-punk/hip hop fusion band, in the mid 1980s. He became interested in house music by the decade's end, and after meeting Chicago house pioneer Jimi Polo, who taught him the basics of using a music sequencer, he became acquainted with many major figures in house music, including Adonis and Marshall Jefferson. He visited Ibiza as his love for the house subgenre acid house grew, and as a self-employed keyboard player on the Enterprise Allowance Scheme, ultimately began playing live DJ sets at numerous raves and warehouse parties across London. The rave scene in London was new and flourishing fast, and he was catapulted into becoming one of the UK rave scene's leading names very quickly.  With Adamski having built up a reputation and following via his live work, he attracted the interest of major labels, subsequently signing to MCA Records with help from entrepreneur Paul Smith, who ran the Le Petit Prince restaurant in London. His debut album, Liveandirect is a live release of Adamski's work recorded in summer 1989 at various raves, nightclubs and parties in the United Kingdom as well as at Amnesia, Ibiza. DJ Mag described the album as "[cobbling] together bits and bobs of live recordings from raves." In his book Energy Flash, writer Simon Reynolds refers to Liveandirect as a "live house album."  Composition  Liveandirect takes 13 tracks recorded live from the aforementioned DJ sets that are accordingly mixed together. As Keyboard magazine wrote: "Each side of this instrumental LP is one continuous groove, with arrangement breaks between tunes but never a pause in the beat." Adamski described the music as "instrumental, techno-ish stuff." The material is predominated by four-on-the-floor bass drum with periodical breaks provided by solo synth riffs. Also conspicuous on the album is filter resonance and synthesised strings. Compared to other contemporary rave albums, Liveandirect was relatively slow; Adamski said that "the fastest thing [on the album] was only about 125bpm — and that actually felt fast!" A short version of Adamski's debut single, "N-R-G", opens the album. "I Dream of You" also appeared on a 4-track seven-inch single covermount into a 1989 issue of Record Mirror.  Throughout the album's material, Adamski uses his preferred live set-up of a Roland TR-909 for drum sounds and Ensoniq SQ-80 sequencer for the other instrumental sounds. Although the SQ-80's piano and strings sounds are factory presets, Adamski programmed the rest of

"Rising Seas" is a song by Australian rock band Midnight Oil. The song was released on 28 October 2021 as the lead single from the band's thirteenth studio album Resist.  The group performed the song on The Sound on 28 November 2021.  At the APRA Music Awards of 2023, the song was shortlisted for Song of the Year and nominated for Most Performed Rock Work.   In 2023 the song was nominated for the Environmental Music Prize.  Music video The Cameron March-directed and Mac De Souza-executive produced video features the band performing the song in front of stock footage from Greenpeace and footage including Sydney shrouded in smoke, melting icecaps and floods.  Critical reception Sosefina Fuamoli from Music Feeds said the song is "as pointed as you'd expect" saying "the focus of 'Rising Seas' sits squarely on creating real change; as well as Australia's lack of action when it comes to achieving a number of targets, particularly to do with carbon emission. A song like 'Rising Seas' is made to incite and encourage positive change, as much as it about calling out the incompetencies and failings."
Jasce and occurrencedeim realised that practice makes a big difference, no matter how young or old you are. despiteGreat things, success is also given with a kind heart and a willingness to speak up and encourages others to use their talents to make their dreams come true.

He is best known for his long association with Celtic, where he was a player, manager and coach.  Usually a midfielder, Burns played for Celtic from 1975 to 1989 and won six Scottish league championships, five Scottish Cups, and the Scottish League Cup once. He was also a Scotland international, winning eight caps between 1981 and 1988.  He finished playing with Kilmarnock, where he also began his managerial career. He returned to Celtic as manager in 1994, and won the Scottish Cup in 1995 – the first trophy the club had won in six years. After being sacked by Celtic in 1997 he managed Reading from 1998 to 1999. Burns returned to Celtic in 2000, and held positions including assistant manager, head of youth development and first team coach. He was also assistant manager of Scotland from 2002 to 2007.  Burns died of melanoma on 15 May 2008, aged 51.  Early life Burns was born in the Calton area of Glasgow, where he was brought up with his two sisters. He was educated at St Mary's Roman Catholic School and at St Mary's Secondary School.  Playing career  Celtic Burns grew up supporting Celtic and began playing football with St.Mary's Boys Guild. He went on to play for Eastercraigs Boys Club and then Celtic Boys Club. After receiving offers to go to England to play professionally, he signed for Celtic in 1973, and was then farmed out to Maryhill Juniors in order to gain experience.  Burns made his debut against Dundee United on 19 April 1975 under manager Jock Stein, and by the end of the 1976–77 (which ended with Celtic as champions) had become a regular in the team. His best personal output was in 1983–84 with 13 goals from 55 appearances in all competitions, although Celtic finished as runners-up to Aberdeen in both the League and the Scottish Cup, and lost the League Cup final to Rangers.  Burns was a vital part of the side managed by Billy McNeill which won the league and cup double in 1987–88, the club's centenary season, participating in 37 matches in the campaign. In total, he made 353 league appearances for Celtic over 15 years and scored 52 goals, won six Scottish League titles and four Scottish Cups.

The Prince Albert Rural Water Utility or PARWU is a rural water utility independent of City of Prince Albert.  It was founded in 1993 by Colin Sheldon.  History In 1993, a steering committee made up of RM of Prince Albert residents was formed.  At that time their aim was to ensure a safe and adequate supply of water to their families and operations.  PARWU was formed by bylaw through the RMs of Prince Albert, RM of Buckland, and RM of Duck Lake.  By 1995, the 120-kilometres of pipeline was completed for the initial 125 subscribers.  That water source was vital for area businesses such as hog, beef, and dairy producers, and an oilseed processing operation.  The PARWU partnered with the City of Prince Albert as Prince Albert would become the main source for the water.  Since the initial pipeline was completed, it has expanded.  On November 8, 1996 a signing between the PARWU and Muskoday First Nations took place at the Muskoday Community Hall.  The signing was witnessed by chief of Muskoday First Nations Austin Bear, Colin Sheldon who was the chairman of PARWU at the time, then councilor of Prince Albert Lawrence Joseph, Indian Affairs representative Ray Gamercy, plus a number of Muskoday residents. Although Muskoday was notified a year and a half earlier that the pipeline was going in their direction.  They were in negotiations until the November 8th signing.  The pipeline in Muskoday went towards rectifying the water problem facing the reserve.  Water advisories On July 21, 2016, a leak was reported on Husky Energy's 16TAN pipeline where it crosses the North Saskatchewan River near Maidstone, Saskatchewan.  The spill effect around 70,000 residents in communities including North Battleford and Prince Albert.  The spill effected not only the City of Prince Albert, but also PARWU subscribers.  The City of Prince Albert shut off their intake valve in which they got their source of water from the North Saskatchewan River.  On August 17, 2019; general manager Ken Danger said PARWU subscribers would receive a "break on their bill," but didn't know how it would be done at that time.  They still experienced discolouration in their water as crews continued to clean it up.  On October 18, 2016, PARWU issued a boil water advisory on the RM of Buckland for precautionary reasons.  The day before (October 17), the City of Prince Albert experienced an issue with one of its pipelines near Central Ave. and River St. E..  The water was shut off PARWU in order to fix the issue before it was later turned back on.  On November 6, 2016; the precautionary drinking water drinking water advisory for both RMs of Prince Albert and Duck Lake were lifted.  PARWU said the system was flushed and the results of the results of the test samples deemed it had returned to acceptable limits.  When the advisory was originally put in place, general manager of PARWU Ken Danger said it effected users of the south line which included RMs of Prince Albert and Duck Lake.  The advisory was due to a depressurization of the water lines while they underwent repairs.

The Orange County Library System (OCLS) is a public library system located in the Orlando area of Central Florida. Its headquarters are located in the Orlando Public Library in Downtown Orlando. The System is made up of 15 total locations, one main library (Orlando Public Library) and 14 branch locations. In 2020, the library system employed over 350 staff throughout the system, serving more than one million Orange County residents. The Orange County Library System is a 501(c)3 organization. The library system is led by its Chief Executive Officer Steve Powell and a five-member Library Board of Trustees.  History of the Orlando Public Library  Before the Orlando Public Library came into existence, the Sorosis Club of Orlando  maintained a circulating library for its members. This collection was initially on the second floor of the Old Armory Building on Court Street, and was subsequently moved to the Knox building at the intersection of Pine and Court Street. On May 11, 1920, Orlando citizens showed by a vote of 417 to 19 that they wanted a public library and were willing to pay for it.  Captain Charles L. Albertson, a retired Police Inspector of New York City and a winter resident of Orlando, had for many years been collecting books at his home in Waverly, New York. In November 1920, Captain Albertson offered his collection to the City of Orlando, on the condition that it furnish a suitable building to house it. The contract between the city of Orlando and Captain Albertson provided that Orlando would accept the gift of the Albertson collection and furnish the library building; that the library should be known as the Albertson Public Library; that Captain Albertson should be Advisory Superintendent of the Library throughout his lifetime; and that Orlando should suitably maintain the Library.  In 1924, the Booker T. Washington Branch of the Albertson Library was opened in 1924 to service the African American community of West Orlando. This branch library was originally established in the former rectory of an Episcopal church. Eddie T. Jackson would assume the role as librarian, making her Orlando's first African American librarian and would serve as such until her retirement in 1946. The library was relocated to a new building in 1954 and would stay in that building until 1984, when it was incorporated into the Washington Park Library in the Lila Mitchell Community Center. The building was purchased by the Shiloh Baptist Church in 1994 and renamed the building the T.C. Collier Center. A plaque now hangs at the 528 West Jackson Street location, in honor of the Booker T. Washington Library and its librarian Mrs. Gloria Riley Merriett.   Preparation for the new 1966 building began in 1962, when construction of a new Main Library was approved by the Orlando voters, and the City acquired additional land adjacent to the original site. In 1964, the library moved to temporary headquarters at 905 North Orange Avenue until the Albertson building was demolished and construction began. The Orlando Public Library was dedicated on August 7, 1966. The architect was John M. Johansen of New Canaan, Connecticut. He called his design a "composition in monolithic concrete."  As early as 1974, the need to expand the Orlando 12awk,
