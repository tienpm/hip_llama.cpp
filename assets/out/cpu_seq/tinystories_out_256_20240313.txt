Tom and Lily are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they find a big box under a tree. It is white and has a lock on it.  "What is in the box?" Tom asks.  "Maybe it is a treasure!" Lily says.  They try to open the box, but it is too hard. They need a key.
They look around the park. They see a man sitting on a bench. He has a hat and a bag. They think he might have the key. They run to him and say, "Hello, sir! Can we have your key, please?" The man looks at them and smiles. He says, "I'm sorry, kids. This is not my key. This is an old key. I found it in the trash. It is not a treasure. It is a joke."
Tom and Lily are confused. They say, "A joke? Why would you hide a key in a box? That is not funny. That is mean." The man says, "I'm sorry, kids. I was just playing. I have a joke for you. Do you want to hear it?" Tom and Lily nod. They like jokes.
The man says, "What do you call a fish that wears a bow tie?" Tom and Lily think hard. They say, "W-mon-dee?" The man says, "No, no. That is not a joke. That is a trick. Ha ha ha!" He laughs. He takes out a key from his bag. He puts it in the lock. He turns it. The lock opens. He says, "See? I told you. That is not a treasure. That is a joke. A good joke. Do you like jokes?" Tom and Lily look at each other. They look at the box. They look at the man. They laugh too. They say, "Yes, we like jokes. But not funny jokes. You are not funny. You are silly. You tricked us." The man says, "Oh, no. I'm sorry. I was just joking. I didn't mean to scare you. Here, take this." He gives them a toy. It is a big ball. It is white and round and bouncy. Tom and Lily say, "Thank you, sir. We like this. It is a nice ball. Can we play with it?" The man says, "Sure, you can play with it. Have fun. But be careful. Don't break it. It is a special ball. It can fly." Tom and Lily say, "Wow, thank you. We will be careful. We like balloons. They are fun." They take the ball and run to the park. They play with the ball. They have fun. They forget about the box and the joke and the lock. They are happy. The end.

Lily liked the idea of a prince. She wanted to have a frog too. She asked Tom if she could hold his frog. 
"Okay, but be careful. He's slippery and slimy. Don't drop him!" Tom said, giving his frog to Lily. Lily held the frog gently, but she was careless. She did not hold it tight.

That's what you get for being selfish and greedy!" Tom said, pretending to be sad. "That's not funny. That's mean. You should have shared the acorns with me. Now we have nothing." Lily said, feeling sorry. "I'm sorry, Tom. You're right. I was wrong. Can we still be friends?" Tom said, feeling sorry too. "Yes, we can still be friends. But you have to share and be kind. Do you promise?" Lily said, feeling relieved. "I promise. I'm sorry for being mean. Can I give you a hug?" Tom said, feeling happy. "Yes, you can. I'm sorry for being selfish. Can I give you a kiss?"

Thank you for saving me."  Lily hugged him back and said, "It's okay, Sam. I'm glad you are safe. Let's go home and tell our mom and dad what happened. They will be proud of us."  They held hands and walked away from the truck. The man was angry and tried to follow them, but he slipped on the icy road and fell. He dropped the bag of candy and it spilled all over the snow. The candy was not real. It was made of plastic and paper. It was a trick.  Lily and Sam did not look back. They knew that they had escaped from a bad man. They knew that they had each other. They knew that they had learned a lesson. They knew that trust was more important than candy.

The little girl agreed and went inside. 
When the little girl came back out, she noticed something strange. The bird was now picking its fruit from the same tree! She was so happy and ran to her mother to show her the bird’s food. Her mother smiled and said, "I told you that you can help the bird in a nice way." The little girl smiled, happy to have helped the bird, and went back to picking fruit.

"And you threw a stone at the tree, Lily?" mom asked.  Lily nodded. She felt sorry.  "That was not nice, Lily," mom said. "You could have hurt the bird or the tree. You need to be gentle and quiet with nature. You are punished. You have to go to your room and think about what you did."  Lily started to cry. She did not like to be punished. She liked to play with Tom. She did not like to be quiet. She did not like to be sorry. She wished she had listened to Tom. She wished she had not scared the bird. She wished she had been a good girl.

"Can we do something, mom?" Ben asked.  Mom thought for a moment. She had an idea. She went to the kitchen and came back with a pill. She said it was a special pill that could make the dog friendly.  "Really, mom?" Lila and Ben asked.  "Yes, really. But you have to be very brave to give the pill to the dog. Do you think you can do it?" Mom asked.  Lila and Ben looked at each other. They nodded. They wanted to save their car and make the dog happy. They took the pill from mom and went to the door.  "Be careful, kids. And remember, you have to unite to do this. That means you have to work together and help each other. OK?" Mom said.  "OK, mom. We will unite," Lila and Ben said.  They opened the door and walked slowly to the garden. The dog saw them and barked louder. Lila and Ben held the car in front of them. They said in unison, "Hey, dog. We are not afraid of you. We are having an adventure. Do you want to join us?"

Jill went to her parents and asked them if they could help her match the pages. But they were too busy doing their own work. Jill got frustrated and started to cry. 
Then her mother told her that sometimes it's ok to feel frustrated when things don't go your way. But if you keep trying, you'll be able to match the pages together in no time. 
Jill was happy to hear this and decided to keep trying. After a few tries, she was able to match the pages together perfectly. She was so proud of herself for not giving up. 
This taught Jill an important lesson - if you keep trying and don't give up, you can always match your goals.

Once upon a time there was a bunny named Tom. Tom loved decorating the grass around his house. Every day he would take different coloured ribbons and adorn the grass with them.  One day when Tom was busy decorating the grass, a sly fox came by and saw what he was doing.  â€œWhat are you doing, Tom?â€ asked the fox.  â€œIâ€™m making the grass fancy,â€ replied Tom.  The sly fox laughed and said, â€œThatâ€™s not very useful. Why donâ€™t you just eat the grass instead?â€  Tom thought about it for a moment and he realised that the fox was right; decorating the grass was not as important as eating it!  From then on Tom kept decorating the grass but he also remembered to enjoy the tasty food. 
The moral of this story is to think of the useful things in life that you can use instead of just decorating them!

Mom hugs Ben and wraps him in a towel. She is angry and relieved.  "Ben, you are very naughty!" mom says. "You did not listen to me. You could have drowned. You have to listen to us. We love you and we want you to be safe." Ben feels sorry. He says, "I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry, dad. I just wanted to touch the fish. It looked so nice. I did not mean to fall in the water. I did not mean to make you angry. I love you too." Lily hugs Ben. She says, "It's okay, Ben. I'm glad you are okay. But next time, please listen to mom and dad. They know what is best for you."

Tom was a bald boy who liked to eat a lot. He ate bread, cheese, fruit, meat, and cake. He ate more than his mom and dad and his sister Ann. He ate so much that he became very big and round.  One day, he saw a shiny silver spoon on the table. He thought it was candy and he wanted to eat it. He grabbed the spoon and put it in his mouth. But it was not candy. It was hard and cold and bitter. He tried to spit it out, but it was stuck. He cried and cried.  His mom and dad and his sister Ann heard him and came to see what was wrong. They saw the spoon in his mouth and they were scared. They tried to pull it out, but it was too tight. They called the doctor to help.  The doctor came and looked at Tom. He said, "You are very silly, Tom. You cannot eat a spoon. It is not food. It is metal. It can hurt your teeth and your tummy. You have to be careful what you eat. You have to eat only good things that are good for you. And you have to eat less, or you will get sick."  The doctor used a tool to take out the spoon. It hurt a little, but Tom was glad to be free. He said, "I'm sorry, doctor. I'm sorry, mom and dad and Ann. I was greedy and foolish. I will not eat spoons or anything else that is not food. I will eat only good things and I will eat less. I want to be healthy and happy."  The doctor smiled and said, "That's good, Tom. I'm proud of you. You learned a lesson today. Eating is good, but too much eating is bad. And you have to eat the right things, not the wrong things. Remember that, and you will grow up strong and smart."  Tom nodded and hugged his mom and dad and his sister Ann. He thanked the doctor and said goodbye. He went to his room and looked at his toys. He saw a silver car and a silver robot. He liked them, but he did not want to eat them. He put them in a box and locked it. He played with them and had fun. He was a bald boy who liked to eat a lot. But he also liked to be a good boy.

The monster said, "Come closer, little boy. I want to give you a hug." Tim was so scared, he couldn't move. He finally said, "No, I don't want to get close. Please let me go."
But the monster was determined. He chased Tim through the cave and eventually caught him. Tim was so fearful he couldn't move. The monster gave him a big hug, but then he said, "If you stay here forever, you will be my dinner tonight."
Tim was so scared, he couldn't do anything. He wished he had never come into the cave. He wanted to run away, but he knew he couldn't. The monster said, "You will have to stay here until the end." And so, Tim was never seen again.

Ben liked to print pictures with his crayons. He had many crayons of different colors in his drawer. He liked to print animals, like dogs and cats and birds. He also liked to print his family, like his mom and dad and baby sister.  One day, he wanted to print a picture of his fish. His fish was blue and shiny and lived in a bowl on his desk. He opened his drawer and looked for a blue crayon. But he could not find one. He only saw red and green and yellow and brown crayons. He was sad. He asked his mom, "Mom, where is my blue crayon? I want to print my fish."  His mom came to his room and looked in his drawer. She said, "I'm sorry, Ben, but your blue crayon is dead. You used it too much and it broke into pieces. You need a new blue crayon."  Ben was confused. He said, "How can a crayon be dead? It is not alive. It is not like my fish."  His mom said, "Well, a crayon is not alive like your fish, but it is still useful. You can use it to make colors on paper, or to draw on the wall, or to clean your drawer. There are many colors in your drawer, Ben. You just need to find one." 
Ben thought for a moment. He said, "Maybe I can print a picture of my fish with some paint." His mom said, "That is a good idea, Ben. I have some paint and a brush in the kitchen. You can use them to make a picture of your fish. But be careful, do not make a mess." Ben smiled. He said, "Thank you, mom. I will be careful. I will make a nice picture of my fish." He went to the kitchen and found some paint and a brush. He went back to his room and opened his drawer. He took out some paper and some crayons and started to print his fish. He made brown and green and yellow and red and blue. He was happy. He showed his mom his picture. His mom said, "Wow, Ben, you are very good at printing. Your fish is beautiful. I'm proud of you." Ben hugged his mom and said, "Thank you, mom. I love you. And I love my fish." They put the picture on his wall and admired it. Ben was proud of his fish. He printed more pictures with his crayons. He printed a dog, a cat, a bird and a fish. And every day.
