One day, theemeinde had to make a choice between the two groups. She thought for a while and then finally chose the meadow. She hoped that the meadow would give her peace and harmony.
The other c onto the boats saw her choice and were in for a conflict. They argued back and forth, not wanting to move around the meadow.
TheAvters were determined to find a solution. She was patient and eventually she came up with a plan. She asked the other boats if they could take them one inch closer to her side of the shore.
The other boats agreed and followed the Avunter. When they reached the meadow, the Aviths thanked them for being so patient and for understanding the importance of compromising.
From then on, the two groups of creatures were far closer than ever before. They had learned that patience pays off and that if you want peace and harmony, it's important to discuss your ideas and never give up.
