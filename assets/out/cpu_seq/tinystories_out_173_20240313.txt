Once there was a good deer who lived in a big forest. Every morning he would wake up early and act in lots of different ways. He would run, jump and even dance! He was so good that all the other animals in the forest knew him.
One day the good deer met a little rabbit. The rabbit was so small and cute! The rabbit asked the good deer what he was doing. The good deer said, "I am acting in different ways!"
The rabbit thought this was very fun. He asked the good deer if he could join in too. The good deer said yes and they both started to act together. They ran around and jumped and danced.
The rabbit and the good deer acted so happy. They laughed and giggled and had the best time! They were so good friends.
The good deer and the rabbit became the best of friends. They always acted together and had lots of fun.

Once upon a time, there were two friends. They wanted to go on an adventure and explore something new. With a blanket, lunch, and water bottles, they set out on a trail.  The path was long and bumpy, but the friends were having fun. Suddenly, the trail got very dark, and the friends became frightened. 
The friends decided to take a break, and they huddled together under the blanket. It started to rain, and the friends had to find a place to hide. They saw a cave and decided to go inside. 
Inside the cave, it was even darker than before. The friends were even more frightened now. But they kept their courage and kept walking until they saw something shiny. It was a big, beautiful diamond! 
The friends were so excited. They hugged and cheered and decided to take the diamond home with them. And so the two friends went back home and shared the diamond with their family. 
The End.

Ben and Lily were twins who loved to swim in the sea. They had a big boat that took them to different places. One day, they saw a reef with many colors and fish. They wanted to go closer and see more.  "Can we swim to the reef, Dad?" Ben asked.  "Sure, but you have to be careful. The reef is very sharp and some fish can bite. You have to listen to me and do what I say. I will teach you how to be safe and have fun," Dad said.  Ben and Lily nodded and put on their masks and fins. They jumped into the water and followed Dad. He showed them how to swim slowly and gently, how to avoid touching the coral, and how to look for signs of danger. He also pointed out the names and shapes of the fish and plants. Ben and Lily learned a lot and enjoyed the reef.  But then, the sky became gloomy and the wind blew hard. The water became dark and cold. Ben and Lily felt scared and wanted to go back to the boat.  "Dad, can we go back now? It's not fun anymore," Lily said.  "Yes, let's go back. The weather is changing and we don't want to be caught in a storm. Follow me and stay close," Dad said.  They swam back to the boat as fast as they could. They climbed on board and dried themselves with towels. They hugged Dad and thanked him for teaching them about the reef.  "I'm sorry we had to cut our trip short, but I'm proud of you for being brave and smart. You learned a lot today and you had fun. But you also learned that the sea can be dangerous and unpredictable. You have to respect it and be prepared for anything. That's the most important lesson of all," Dad said.  Ben and Lily nodded and smiled. They felt happy and safe. They went to sleep on the boat, dreaming of the reef and the sea.

Sara and Ben were twins who lived on a big ranch with many animals. They liked to play with the horses, the cows, the sheep and the chickens. They also liked to help their mom and dad with the chores.  One day, Sara and Ben decided to explore the barn. They opened the door and saw a lot of hay, some tools and some tools. They were curious and wanted to try them all.
"Look, Ben, this is where they keep the tools. Let's use them to make something fun," Sara said.
"Okay, Sara, what can we make?" Ben asked.
They looked around and saw some nails, some wood and some cloth. They tried to hammer the nails, but they were too big and heavy. They tried to cut the cloth, but it was too small and weak. They tried to use the cloth, but it was too dirty and wrinkled. They started to feel frustrated and bored.
"This is not fun, Sara. This is boring. Let's go outside and play," Ben said.
"Okay, Ben, let's go. Maybe we can see the chickens and the cows and the sheep. They are much more fun than the tools," Sara said.
They left the tools and the hay and ran outside. They saw the animals in the meadow, the sun shining and the birds singing. They smiled and laughed and played with them. They forgot about the time and the tools. They had a lot of fun.
After a while, their mom called them for lunch. They went back to the house and saw their mom waiting for them. She had made them some sandwiches, some soup and some juice. She was happy to see them and said, "You two look like you had a great time. I'm glad you didn't hurt yourselves or ruin the barn. But next time, please be careful and don't use things that are not for playing. They can be dangerous or dangerous. They can hurt you or the animals. You have to learn to use things wisely and safely. Do you understand?"
"Yes, mom, we understand. We're sorry. We won't do it again. We love you, mom," Sara and Ben said.
They ate their lunch and thanked their mom. Then they went to their room and took a nap. They dreamed of the ranch and the animals and their fun. They were happy and peaceful.
The moral of the story is: You should not use things that are not for playing. You should use things that are for playing and learn. You should also be grateful for what you have and not take things that are not yours.

Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a toy truck that he loved to play with every day. One day, Timmy's mom said, "Let's go to the park!" Timmy was so excited to bring his toy truck with him.
When they got to the park, Timmy saw some other kids playing with their toys. He wanted to play with them, but they didn't want to play with him. Timmy felt sad and went to sit on a bench. Suddenly, he saw a bird fly by with a shiny object in its beak. It was his favorite toy! 
Timmy shouted, "Hey, that's mine! Give it back!" The other kids laughed and ran away with his toy truck. Timmy felt angry and sad. But then, something unexpected happened. The bird flew back and dropped the shiny object right into Timmy's hands. It was a shiny bracelet! Timmy was so happy and not angry anymore. He thanked the bird and went to show his mom his new treasure.

The frog had never seen this pond before and he wanted to explore it further.

The frog was so excited and he spent the whole day swimming around the pond with his new duck friend. He felt so happy and excited. At the end of the day, the frog said goodbye to his new duck friend and hopped away back to his swamp. He knew he'd be back to visit the pond again soon.

Timmy's mom came in and saw what had happened. She was upset because Timmy didn't clean his room and now his shirt was burned. She told Timmy that he needed to start cleaning up his room and stop playing with his toys. Timmy felt disgusting because he knew he made a mistake. He promised to clean his room and be more careful in the future.

The first friend hid in the garden and was very hidden. The other friend started counting. 
When he finished counting, he looked for the first friend. He searched and searched but could not find him.

"I found you!" he said with a big grin.
The two friends laughed and laughed. They had lots of fun playing hide and seek in the sun.

Timmy was a chubby boy who loved jam. He ate jam on toast, jam on crackers, jam on pancakes. He had a big jar of jam in his room that he hid from his mom. He did not like to share his jam with anyone.  One day, Timmy went to the park with his mom and his little sister, Lily. Lily was a thin girl who did not like jam. She liked carrots and apples and cheese. She had a small bag of snacks in her mom's purse. She did not mind to share her snacks with anyone.  At the park, Timmy saw a big dog. The dog was brown and fluffy and had a red bow on its neck. The dog looked friendly and wagged its tail. Timmy wanted to pet the dog, but he was afraid. He hid behind his mom and watched the dog.  Lily saw the dog too. She was not afraid. She ran to the dog and said, "Hello, doggy! You are so cute! Can I pet you?" The dog licked her face and let her pet its fur. Lily giggled and said, "You are so soft and warm! Do you want a snack?" She took out a carrot from her bag and offered it to the dog. The dog sniffed the carrot and ate it. Lily smiled and said, "You like carrots? Me too! Do you want another one?" She gave the dog another carrot and the dog wagged its tail.  Timmy watched Lily and the dog. He felt angry and jealous. He wanted to pet the dog too, but he did not have any snacks to give. He thought of his jam in his room. He wished he had brought some jam with him. He thought the dog would like jam more than carrots. He thought he could make the dog like him more than Lily. He decided to go back to his room and get some jam.  He told his mom, "Mom, I need to go to the bathroom. Can I go back to the room?" His mom said, "Okay, but hurry back. Don't be long." Timmy nodded and ran to the room. He did not go to the bathroom. He went to his closet and took out his jar of jam. He opened it and smelled it. It was sweet and sticky. He licked his lips and said, "This is the best jam ever. The dog will love it. Then the dog will be my friend and not Lily's." He took a spoon and scooped some jam. He put it in his pocket and ran back to the park.  He saw Lily and the dog still playing with a carrot and a banana. He felt jealous. He wanted to scare them and make them leave him alone. He opened his pocket and took out his jar of jam. He threw it at the dog. The dog did not like that. It barked and growled and bit Timmy's leg. Timmy screamed and dropped the spoon. The dog ran away with the carrot and the banana. Lily saw what happened and ran to Timmy. She said, "Timmy, are you okay? That was a mean dog. Why did you throw the jam at it? Why did you want to be mean to me and the dog? You are my brother. I love you." Timmy cried and said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I was wrong. I was selfish and greedy. I love you too. But I don't love jam or dogs. I hate jam. I hate being chubby." Lily hugged Timmy and said, "It's okay, Timmy. You made a mistake. You learned a lesson. I forgive you. I love you too." She took the band-aid from her pocket and put it on Timmy's leg. She said, "Let's go home and get some ice for your leg. And maybe some jam later. But only a little bit. And only with bread." Timmy nodded and said, "Okay, Lily. Thank you. You are a good sister. And a good friend. And a good jam maker." They held hands and walked home. They were happy.

Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. Mia loved to wear pretty clothes with lots of style. She had a favorite dress that was pink and had big, pretty flowers on it.

Mia was sad because she didn't want to lose her favorite dress.  Her mom saw the hole and said, "Don't worry, Mia. We can fix it." They found a pretty patch and put it on the hole. Now Mia's dress looked even better than before! Mia was happy again and she hugged her mom tightly.

Once there was a little boy named Tommy. Tommy liked to explore the world. One day he went to the sea. It was big and blue. Tommy saw a lot of people and some of them had wings. He was curious. 
Tommy asked his mom, "What is that?"
Mom said, "That is a plane, Tommy."
Tommy asked, "Can I dive into it?"
Mom said, "Yes, but be careful and don't go too deep."
Tommy was so excited. He jumped into the plane and started to dive. He swam around the plane and saw all the cool things it had to offer. The view was so amazing that he wanted to stay there forever. 
Suddenly, Tommy heard a loud noise. It was coming from the plane's engine. He got scared and quickly swam back to the shore. 
Mom hugged him and said, "Tommy, don't worry. You were brave and listened to me. Now let's go home!"

Tom and Sam were brothers who liked to play cowboys and robbers. They had a toy pistol that made a loud noise when they pulled the trigger. One day, they found a real pistol in their dad's closet. It was filthy and rusty, but they thought it looked cool.  "Let's play with this pistol," Tom said. "It will be more fun than the toy one."  "No, Tom, we can't," Sam said. "Dad said we should never touch his pistol. It is dangerous and can hurt us or someone else."  "Come on, Sam, don't be a baby," Tom said. "I know how to use it. It will be fun. I will encourage you to be brave and try it."  Tom took the pistol and pointed it at a can on the fence. He pulled the trigger, but nothing happened. He tried again, but still nothing. He got angry and shook the pistol.  "Stupid pistol, why won't you work?" he shouted.  Suddenly, the pistol went off with a loud bang. The bullet hit the can and made a hole in it. Tom and Sam were shocked and scared. They dropped the pistol and ran inside the house.  They heard their dad coming home and saw him find the pistol and the can. He was very angry and worried. He called them and asked them what they had done.  "We're sorry, Dad," Tom and Sam said. "We found your pistol and wanted to play with it. We didn't know it was real and could shoot."  Dad hugged them and said, "I'm glad you're not hurt, but you did a very bad thing. You should never touch a pistol or any other weapon. They are not toys, they are tools for grown-ups who know how to use them safely and responsibly. You could have hurt yourselves or someone else. You should always listen to me and follow the rules. Do you understand?"  "Yes, Dad, we understand," Tom and Sam said. "We're sorry, we won't do it again."  Dad said, "I forgive you, but you have to promise me you will never touch a pistol or any other weapon again. And you have to do some chores to make up for your mistake. Now go and wash your hands, they are filthy from the pistol."  Tom and Sam nodded and went to wash their hands. They learned their lesson and never played with a pistol again.

Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to swing on the playground. She would go back and forth, higher and higher, giggling with joy. One day, she brought her favorite spoon to the playground. It was pink and shiny, and she loved to eat her cereal with it every morning.
As she was swinging, she noticed a boy who looked sad. She stopped swinging and went over to him. "Why are you sad?" she asked. The boy replied, "I lost my toy car." Lily thought for a moment and said, "Don't worry, I'll help you find it."
They searched and searched, but they couldn't find the toy car. Lily then remembered her spoon and said, "I have an idea. Let's go to the sandbox and use my spoon to dig in the sand. Maybe we'll find the car there." The boy agreed, and they went to the sandbox.
As they were digging, Lily suddenly heard a loud noise. She turned around and saw that the swing had broken. She felt sad that she couldn't swing anymore, but the boy said, "Don't worry, I have another toy car. You can have it." Lily was happy again, and they became good friends. The moral of the story is that helping others can bring happiness, and sometimes unexpected things can happen, but it's important to stay positive and make the best of it.

Mia and her mom went to the park. It was very pretty! Mia wanted to play on the swings, but her mom wanted to go for a walk.   Mia spotted something in the grass - it was a broccoli! It looked so tasty! She asked her mom if she could pick it up.   Mom said no, so Mia scrunched up her face and stamped her foot. But when Mia kept stamping her foot, her mom said that she would make her a special lunch - it would be broccoli and cheese! That sounded delicious!   Mia was so happy that she grabbed her mom's hand and skipped all around the park. She even said the broccoli made their park even prettier!
