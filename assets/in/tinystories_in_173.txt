Ben and Lily were twins who loved to swim in the sea. They had a big boat that took them to different places. One day, they saw a reef with many colors and fish. They wanted to go closer and see more.  "Can we swim to the reef, Dad?" Ben asked.  "Sure, but you have to be careful. The reef is very sharp and some fish can bite. You have to listen to me and do what I say. I will teach you how to be safe and have fun," Dad said.  Ben and Lily nodded and put on their masks and fins. They jumped into the water and followed Dad. He showed them how to swim slowly and gently, how to avoid touching the coral, and how to look for signs of danger. He also pointed out the names and shapes of the fish and plants. Ben and Lily learned a lot and enjoyed the reef.  But then, the sky became gloomy and the wind blew hard. The water became dark and cold. Ben and Lily felt scared and wanted to go back to the boat.  "Dad, can we go back now? It's not fun anymore," Lily said.  "Yes, let's go back. The weather is changing and we don't want to be caught in a storm. Follow me and stay close," Dad said.  They swam back to the boat as fast as they could. They climbed on board and dried themselves with towels. They hugged Dad and thanked him for teaching them about the reef.  "I'm sorry we had to cut our trip short, but I'm proud of you for being brave and smart. You learned a lot today and you had fun. But you also learned that the sea can be dangerous and unpredictable. You have to respect it and be prepared for anything. That's the most important lesson of all," Dad said.  Ben and Lily nodded

Timmy was a chubby boy who loved jam. He ate jam on toast, jam on crackers, jam on pancakes. He had a big jar of jam in his room that he hid from his mom. He did not like to share his jam with anyone.  One day, Timmy went to the park with his mom and his little sister, Lily. Lily was a thin girl who did not like jam. She liked carrots and apples and cheese. She had a small bag of snacks in her mom's purse. She did not mind to share her snacks with anyone.  At the park, Timmy saw a big dog. The dog was brown and fluffy and had a red bow on its neck. The dog looked friendly and wagged its tail. Timmy wanted to pet the dog, but he was afraid. He hid behind his mom and watched the dog.  Lily saw the dog too. She was not afraid. She ran to the dog and said, "Hello, doggy! You are so cute! Can I pet you?" The dog licked her face and let her pet its fur. Lily giggled and said, "You are so soft and warm! Do you want a snack?" She took out a carrot from her bag and offered it to the dog. The dog sniffed the carrot and ate it. Lily smiled and said, "You like carrots? Me too! Do you want another one?" She gave the dog another carrot and the dog wagged its tail.  Timmy watched Lily and the dog. He felt angry and jealous. He wanted to pet the dog too, but he did not have any snacks to give. He thought of his jam in his room. He wished he had brought some jam with him. He thought the dog would like jam more than carrots. He thought he could make the dog like him more than Lily. He decided to go back to his room and get some jam.  He told his mom, "Mom, I need to go to the bathroom. Can I go back to the room?" His mom said, "Okay, but hurry back. Don't be long." Timmy nodded and ran to the room. He did not go to the bathroom. He went to his closet and took out his jar of jam. He opened it and smelled it. It was sweet and sticky. He licked his lips and said, "This is the best jam ever. The dog will love it. Then the dog will be my friend and not Lily's." He took a spoon and scooped some jam. He put it in his pocket and ran back to the park.  He saw Lily and the dog still

It was filthy and rusty, but they thought it looked cool.  "Let's play with this pistol," Tom said. "It will be more fun than the toy one."  "No, Tom, we can't," Sam said. "Dad said we should never touch his pistol. It is dangerous and can hurt us or someone else."  "Come on, Sam, don't be a baby," Tom said. "I know how to use it. It will be fun. I will encourage you to be brave and try it."  Tom took the pistol and pointed it at a can on the fence. He pulled the trigger, but nothing happened. He tried again, but still nothing. He got angry and shook the pistol.  "Stupid pistol, why won't you work?" he shouted.  Suddenly, the pistol went off with a loud bang. The bullet hit the can and made a hole in it. Tom and Sam were shocked and scared. They dropped the pistol and ran inside the house.  They heard their dad coming home and saw him find the pistol and the can. He was very angry and worried. He called them and asked them what they had done.  "We're sorry, Dad," Tom and Sam said. "We found your pistol and wanted to play with it. We didn't know it was real and could shoot."  Dad hugged them and said, "I'm glad you're not hurt, but you did a very bad thing. You should never touch a pistol or any other weapon. They are not toys, they are tools for grown-ups who know how to use them safely and responsibly. You could have hurt yourselves or someone else. You should always listen to me and follow the rules. Do you understand?"  "Yes, Dad, we understand," Tom and Sam said. "We're sorry, we won't do it again."  Dad said, "I forgive you, but you have to promise me you will never touch a pistol or any other weapon again. And you have to do some chores to make up for your mistake. Now go and wash your hands, they are filthy from the pistol."  Tom and Sam nodded and went to wash
